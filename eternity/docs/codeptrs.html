The Eternity Engine Definitive Code Pointer Reference -- 12/11/03
<hr>

<a href="../etcengine.html">Return to the Eternity Engine Page</a>

This is a reference that should be of value to DeHackEd patch authors.
It exposes full information on all the code pointers available in
the Eternity Engine, including both those from DOOM and those added in
later ports. This reference attempts to expose all issues related to
their use, as well as common pitfalls that lead to nasty crashes.

The information in this guide is up to date for Eternity Engine v3.31
public beta 6, except where later changes are noted.

Changes
<hr width="60%" align="left"></a>

12/11/03: Updated FireCustomBullets, CustomPlayerMelee, and PlayerThunk entries
          to reflect changes in EE v3.31 public beta 5.  Added missing entry
          for MissileAttack that should have been present for beta 4.  Fixed
          an error in the entry for KeenDie.

<a name="pitfall"><hr width="60%" align="left">
General Pitfall and Note on the Type Information:
<hr width="60%" align="left"></a>

General code pointers can be used in any frame that is not a player gun frame.
Player Gun Frame code pointers cannot be used anywhere except in player gun
frames. If a code pointer is used in the wrong type of frame, the internal 
function call stack will be corrupted, a "Segmentation Violation" error will 
most likely occur, and Cyberdemons will come to get you in the night. This
isn't an Eternity bug or limitation. This problem would eventually manifest
itself even in the original doom.exe, as a sudden, unexplained Venetian Blinds
crash. There is additionally no way to type-check codepointers at run-time,
so the user must accept this responsibility.

Note that as of Eternity Engine v3.31 public beta 3, there is a special
codepointer called PlayerThunk, usable via EDF, which allows player gun frames
to call a select set of monster codepointers by proxy.

Parameterized pointers take parameters via fields on the frame in which they
are used. The code pointer parameter information will indicate what fields are
used as parameters, and what parameter values mean.

<a name="damage"><hr width="40%" align="left">
Note on Damage Formulae:
<hr width="40%" align="left"></a>

Most damage in DOOM uses a random number, a modulus value, and a multiplier.
In general, damage formulae will appear like this:

(rnd%modulus + 1) * multiplier

where rnd is a random number between 0 and 255, unless otherwise noted.

(rnd%modulus) + 1 results in a range of numbers from 1 to modulus, so
if the following formula is shown:

(rnd%8 + 1) * 3

then the range of damage values is multiples of 3 from 3 to 24, since
1*3 = 3 and 8*3 = 24. Where damage values involve the summation of several
random "dice" throws or other, more complicated formulae, the damage range
will be shown explicitly for convenience.

Player Gun Frame Code Pointers
<hr></a>

<a name="wmp"><hr width="40%" align="left">
Weapon Maintenance Pointers
<hr width="40%" align="left"></a>

* Light0
  Type:    Weapon maintenance, normal
  Purpose: Turns off any lighting flashes caused by firing a weapon.
  
  
* Light1
  Type:    Weapon maintenance, normal
  Purpose: Causes a first-level light flash to occur for the player
           shooting the weapon.
  Notes:   Weapon flashes do not function on levels that use special
           global colormaps. Light must be subsequently returned to
           normal by using the Light0 code pointer above.
  
           
* Light2
  Type:    Weapon maintenance, normal
  Purpose: Causes a second-level light flash to occur for the player
           shooting the weapon.
  Notes:   Weapon flashes do not function on levels that use special
           global colormaps. Light must be subsequently returned to
           normal by using the Light0 code pointer above.
  
  
* WeaponReady
  Type:    Weapon maintenance, normal
  Purpose: Readies a weapon for firing or change, should be used after
           the weapon's raise sequence and fire sequence.
  
  
* Lower
  Type:    Weapon maintenance, normal
  Purpose: Lowers the current weapon and changes to a newly selected one,
           unless the player is dead. Should be called from the weapon's
           lowering sequence.
  
           
* Raise
  Type:    Weapon maintenance, normal
  Purpose: Raises a new weapon to normal position. Should be called from
           a weapon's raise sequence.


* ReFire
  Type:    Weapon maintenance, normal
  Purpose: Allows a weapon to restart its firing sequence without returning
           to its ready sequence. If the player does not have enough ammo
           to fire again, the weapon will be lowered and replaced.

           
* CheckReload
  Type:    Weapon maintenance, normal
  Purpose: Checks the ammo for a weapon to see if a weapon change should
           occur before the reload frames are entered. Used in particular
           by the super shotgun.
  Notes:   This code pointer does not function properly in BOOM, MBF, or
           SMMU, and will fail to make the weapon lower before completing
           its reload frames. This problem has been repaired in Eternity.

           
* GunFlash
  Type:    Weapon maintenance, normal
  Purpose: Allows weapon kickback to be synchronized with the gun's firing
           frames as opposed to when the player presses the trigger. This
           code pointer is new as of BOOM, and is used by the BFG so that
           kickback does not occur until after BFG delay. It would work
           for any weapon with a similar firing delay. Should be called
           from one of the weapon's firing frames.

<a href="#contents">Return to Table of Contents</a>


<a name="pap"><hr width="40%" align="left">
Player Attack Pointers
<hr width="40%" align="left"></a>

* Punch
  Type:    Player attack, normal
  Purpose: Performs the standard player punch attack. Hits for damage with
           the formula (rnd%10 + 1) * 2 when the player is normal. If the
           player is berserk, this value is multiplied by 10. The player can
           only hit when within melee range (64 units). If a hit is successful,
           the player will turn to directly face the target and will emit the
           DSPUNCH sound effect.


* FirePistol
  Type:    Player attack, normal
  Purpose: Fires a single bullet for standard player tracer damage --
           (rnd%3 + 1) * 5 -- Accuracy will be perfect on the first shot, but
           will use "never" accuracy if the gun is fired repeatedly. The player
           object will transfer to its second attack frame when this pointer is 
           used. The player will emit the DSPISTOL sound effect.

           
* FireShotgun
  Type:    Player attack, normal
  Purpose: Fires player shotgun attack. Seven tracers are fired using "never"
           accuracy (a moderate horizontal spread with no vertical error), each
           doing standard bullet damage of (rnd%3 + 1) * 5. The player object
           will transfer to its second attack frame when this pointer is used.
           The player will emit the DSSHOTGN sound effect.


* FireShotgun2
  Type:    Player attack, normal
  Purpose: Fires player super shotgun attack. Twenty tracers are fired using
           "ssg" accuracy (wide horizontal spread combined with moderate 
           vertical error), each tracer doing standard bullet damage of
           (rnd%3 + 1) * 5. The player object will transfer to its second
           attack state, and will emit the DSDSHTGN sound effect.

           
* FireCGun
  Type:    Player attack, normal
  Purpose: Fires player chaingun attack. Fires one tracer for standard bullet
           damage of (rnd%3 + 1) * 5. Accuracy will be perfect on the first
           shot, but will use "never" accuracy on subsequent shots. The player 
           object will transfer to its second attack state, and will emit the 
           DSCHGUN sound effect.
  Notes:   If no DSCHGUN sound is present amongst all WAD files, the DSCHGUN
           sound effect will be dynamically remapped to DSPISTOL. This behavior
           is new as of SMMU.

           
* FireMissile
  Type:    Player attack, normal
  Purpose: Fires a single RocketShot projectile.

  
* Saw
  Type:    Player attack, normal
  Purpose: Performs a player chainsaw attack. Hits for (rnd%10 + 1) * 2 damage
           once per call. Player must be within melee range + 1 unit (65 units)
           in order to hit with this attack. If the attack misses, the player
           will emit the DSSAWFUL sound effect. If the attack hits, the player
           will emit the DSSAWHIT sound effect, and his/her current angle will
           be set directly toward the target, and then will be randomly 
           deflected 4.5 degrees to the right or left. The JUSTATTACKED flag 
           will be set for the player object, causing slight forward movement.

           
* FirePlasma
  Type:    Player attack, normal
  Purpose: Fires a single PlasmaShot projectile. Has a 50% chance of causing 
           the weapon to stall by entering its reload state after firing.

           
* FireBFG
  Type:    Player attack, normal
  Purpose: Fires a single BFGShot projectile.

<a name="mwp"><hr width="40%" align="left">
Miscellaneous Weapon Pointers
<hr width="40%" align="left"></a>
           
* BFGsound
  Type:    Weapon miscellaneous, normal
  Purpose: Player object will emit the DSBFG sound.


* OpenShotgun2
  Type:    Weapon miscellaneous, normal
  Purpose: Player object will emit the DSDBOPN sound effect.

  
* LoadShotgun2
  Type:    Weapon miscellaneous, normal
  Purpose: Player object will emit the DSDBLOAD sound effect.


* CloseShotgun2
  Type:    Weapon miscellaneous, normal
  Purpose: Player object will emit the DSDBCLS sound effect, and then control
           will transfer to the ReFire code pointer, which will check for
           weapon refire.

<a name="ppap"><hr width="40%" align="left">
Parameterized Player Attack Pointers
<hr width="40%" align="left"></a>
           
* FireCustomBullets
  Type:    Player attack, parameterized
  
  Parameter Information:
  * Args1 = DeHackEd number of sound to play (default of 0 = no sound)
  * Args2 = Select accuracy type (default of 0 = 1)
            * 1 = Always accurate
            * 2 = Accurate on first fire only ("never" accurate afterward)
            * 3 = Never accurate 
                  (moderate horizontal spread with no vertical error)
            * 4 = Super Shotgun accuracy
                  (wide horizontal spread with moderate vertical error)
            * 5 = Monster accuracy (very wide horizontal spread)
  * Args3 = Number of bullet tracers to fire (default of 0 = 0)
  * Args4 = Damage factor (Damage formula is: dmgfactor * ((rnd%dmgmod) + 1))
  * Args5 = Damage modulus
            (Forced into range of 1 to 256)
  
  Purpose: Extremely powerful codepointer that allows construction of custom
           player bullet weapons. The sound, accuracy, number of tracers, and
           randomized damage range of the tracers are all selectable via the
           argument fields of the frame calling this codepointer. It is
           possible to recreate any of the other bullet attacks in the game
           using this pointer, as well as create many totally new ones.
           New to Eternity.
  Notes:   The Args1 parameter has been changed as of EE v3.31 public beta 5
           to use a sound DeHackEd number as defined via EDF.  This allows
           this pointer to use any sound, including those defined in user
           EDF files.

           
* FirePlayerMissile
  Type:    Player attack, Homing missile firing pointer, parameterized
  
  Parameter Information:
  * Args1 = DeHackEd Number of thing type to shoot (must be valid, no default)
  * Args2 = Select homing property (default of 0 = 0)
            * 0 = will not home
            * 1 = may home
            
  Purpose: Allows a custom player projectile attack. The type of missile to
           fire is given as the thing type's DeHackEd number in Args1. If this
           type is invalid, this codepointer does nothing. If Args2 is set to
           1 and the missile fired has a homing maintenance codepointer in its
           frames, the missile will home on the player's current autoaiming
           target, if one exists. New to Eternity.
  Notes:   A missile cannot home unless its frames contain a homing maintenance
           codepointer. These pointers include:
           * Tracer
           * GenTracer
           * HticTracer

           
* CustomPlayerMelee
  Type:    Player attack, parameterized
  
  Parameter Information:
  * Args1 = Damage factor (Damage formula is: dmgfactor * ((rnd%dmgmod) + 1))
  * Args2 = Damage modulus (Forced into range of 1 to 256)
  * Args3 = Berserk multiplier (default 0, x*damage when player is berserk)
  * Args4 = Select angle deflection type (default of 0 = 1)
            * 1 = None
            * 2 = Punch (player will face object on hit)
            * 3 = Chainsaw (player will face object and be wiggled around)
  * Args5 = DeHackEd number of sound to play (default of 0 = no sound)
            
  Purpose: Extremely powerful codepointer that allows construction of custom
           player melee attacks. Two major classes of attacks are possible,
           punch-style and chainsaw-style, depending on the parameters given.
           Note that the Berserk multiplier can be applied to any attack,
           but that if it is 0, you will do zero damage when berserk! The
           Berserk multiplier should be 1 when no berserk bonus is desired.
           New to Eternity.
  Notes:   The Args5 parameter has been changed as of EE v3.31 public beta 5
           to use a sound DeHackEd number as defined via EDF.  This allows
           this pointer to use any sound, including those defined in user
           EDF files.


* PlayerThunk
  Type:    Player attack, parameterized
  
  Parameter Information:
  * Args1 = Codepointer to call (no default, must be valid)
  * Args2 = Select target facing behavior (default of 0 = 0)
            * 0 = FaceTarget pointer has no effect
            * 1 = FaceTarget pointer is active
  * Args3 = DeHackEd number of state to put player in temporarily 
            (default of 0 = 0; negative value = no state change)
  * Args4 = Select targeting behavior (default of 0 = 0)
            * 0 = Player targets last attacker, if any
            * 1 = Player targets current autoaim target, if any 
                  (attack fails if none)
  * Args5 = Select ammo usage (default of 0 = 0)
            * 0 = No ammo is used
            * 1 = Normal amount of ammo is used, if applicable
                  (see note below about autoaim targeting)
                              
  Purpose: Allows player gun frames to call a select set of monster code-
           pointers which have been determined as safe for use in this
           context. If the index parameter indicates an invalid codepointer,
           or any of the other parameters have invalid values, nothing
           will occur. New to Eternity.
  Notes:   If targeting behavior is set to autoaim, and ammo usage is on, no 
           ammo is used unless the player follows through with an attack on 
           his current target. Otherwise, ammo would be used despite no attack 
           occuring. This may become an additional ammo usage option in the 
           future.           
           Behavior of monster codepointers when applied to the player will
           in general be exactly as described for monsters. The Args3 field 
           is provided for use with parameterized code-pointers, so that they 
           can retrieve args values from a different frame. The player will 
           NOT display a sprite, call an action function, or cause a particle
           event from this state.
           *** The Args3 parameter's behavior has been changed slightly as
           of EE v3.31 public beta 5. Formerly, the default value zero meant
           no state change would occur, but this was inappropriate. Now, a
           negative number means no state, and zero means whatever state
           is defined to have DeHackEd number zero (S_NULL by default).
  
  Special Information:
           This codepointer is only usable via EDF. The first argument must
           be specified in an EDF frame block's args list using the following
           syntax:
           
           args = { bexptr:&lt;codepointer mnemonic&gt; }
           
           where &lt;codepointer mnemonic&gt; is one of the following pointer

* BFGSpray
  Type:    Miscellaneous, normal
  Purpose: Causes BFG explosion effects, which differ depending upon the
           player's selected type of BFG:
           1) Normal BFG:
              40 tracers will eminate from the object which fired the
              projectile in the general direction in which the projectile
              was fired, each doing damage that is the sum of 16 rolls of
              an 8-sided die (Absolute damage range per tracer is 16 to 128, 
              absolute damage range of ALL tracers is 640 to 5120).
           2) BFG 11K:
              Control is transferred to the BFG11KHit codepointer
           3) Bouncing BFG:
              Control is transferred to the BouncingBFG codepointer
           4) Plasma Burst BFG:
              Control is transferred to the BFGBurst codepointer


* BFG11KHit
  Type:    Miscellaneous, normal
  Purpose: Explosion effect of BFG 11k weapon. Designed for more balanced play
           in deathmatch, this BFG works very differently. First, if the BFG
           ball explodes closer than 96 units to its originator, the originator
           will take damage proportional to that distance. The damage
           calculation is the sum of floor(48 - (distance / 2)) rolls of an 
           8-sided die. At 95 units away, the damage is 0. At 0 units away, the
           damage ranges from 48 to 384. The originator is hit directly for
           this damage, and a BFGFlash object is spawned at his/her location.
           40 tracers will be fired out in a circular pattern from the 
           explosion location. These tracers cannot hit the originator of the
           missile. These tracers will hit for damage equal to the sum of 20
           rolls of an 8-sided die (damage range per tracer is 20 to 160, 
           damage range of all tracers together is 800 to 6400). When a target
           is hit, an BFGFlash object will be spawned at its location. 
           New to Eternity.
           

* BouncingBFG
  Type:    Miscellaneous, normal
  Purpose: Explosion effect of Bouncing BFG weapon. This BFG does not do any
           tracer-based damage. Instead, 40 test traces are fired in a circular
           pattern from the point of explosion. The first of these tracers to
           hit a living object selects that object as the target. If the same
           object was targetted just prior in this weapon's propagation
           process, it will not be targetted again and the process will stop.
           If this is the 16th time the process has repeated, the process
           will also stop. If a valid target is acquired, a new BFGShot 
           projectile will be fired from the current projectile's location 
           toward the target. This bouncing can occur up to 16 times, as noted 
           before. New to Eternity.
  Notes:   This effect will not work unless the original projectile was
           fired by the FireBFG player gun codepointer.
           
           
* BFGBurst
  Type:    Miscellaneous, normal
  Purpose: Explosion effect of the Plasma Burst BFG weapon. This BFG does not
           do tracer-based damage. Instead, 40 EEBetaPlasma3 projectiles will 
           be fired from the point of explosion in a circular pattern, with
           randomized small positive or negative z momentum, such that they
           tend to bounce off the floor. The new projectiles cannot hit the
           originator of the BFG projectile. Based on the BFG from the
           unreleased MagDOOM source port by Cephaler. New to Eternity.


* Mushroom
  Type:    Miscellaneous, parameterized
  
  Parameter Information:
  * Unknown 1 = Fixed-point launch angle factor (default of 0 = 4 units)
  * Unknown 2 = Fixed-point missile momentum factor (default of 0 = 1/2 unit)
  * Args1     = DeHackEd number of thing type to spawn 
                (default of 0 = MancubusShot)
  
  Purpose: Causes a mushroom cloud effect. The object will first call the
           Explode codepointer for primary blast radius damage. Then, a
           number of MancubusShot projectiles proportional to the object's
           missile damage field will be launched into the air in a circular 
           pattern, using the angle and speed parameters provided in the 
           current frame. This codepointer is new to MBF.
  Notes:   The Args1 parameter is new to Eternity Engine v3.31 beta 4. It
           allows the thing type fired to be overridden. If this parameter
           is not provided, the default MancubusShot will be used.
           
           
* Nailbomb
  Type:    Miscellaneous, normal
  Purpose: Causes a blast radius attack with radius and max damage value of
           128, and then fires 30 bullet tracers in a circular spread for
           10 damage each. New to SMMU.
           
           
* SetFlags
  Type:    Miscellaneous, parameterized
  
  Parameter Information:
  * Args1 = Select Bits Field (no default)
            * 1 = Bits
            * 2 = Bits2
            * 3 = Bits3
  * Args2 = Value to Logical-OR with selected Bits field (default of 0 = 0)
  
  Purpose: Adds the flags set in Args2 to the object's Bits field
           selected by Args1. This "turns on" effects controlled by those
           bits. New to Eternity.
           
           
* UnSetFlags
  Type:    Miscellaneous, parameterized
  
  Parameter Information:
  * Args1 = Select Bits Field (no default)
            * 1 = Bits
            * 2 = Bits2
            * 3 = Bits3
  * Args2 = Value to Inverse-Logical-AND with selected Bits field 
            (default of 0 = 0)
            
  Purpose: Removes the flags set in Args2 from the object's Bits field 
           selected by Args1. This "turns off" effects controlled by those
           bits. New to Eternity.


* Fall
  Type:    Miscellaneous, normal
  Purpose: Removes the solid flag from the object, allowing it to be walked
           over.

           
* Die
  Type:    Miscellaneous, normal
  Purpose: Causes the object to die by damaging it for its current health.
           This codepointer is new to MBF.

           
* BrainScream
  Type:    Miscellaneous, normal
  Purpose: Boss Brain Explosion. Spawns RocketShot objects from the point
           (object.x - 196, object.y - 320, z) to the point
           (object.x + 320, object.y - 320, z), stepping 8 units along the
           x axis for each spawn, and using a random z coordinate of
           128 + (rnd * 2). Each RocketShot object will be given a random
           z momentum of (512 * rnd), will be set to frame S_BRAINEXPLODE1
           (#799), and will have its state's length modified by a random 
           amount of 0 to 7 gametics, not allowing the frame length to be 
           less than 1 tic. The object will then play the DSBOSDTH sound 
           effect at full volume.

           
* BrainExplode
  Type:    Miscellaneous, normal
  Purpose: Boss Brain Explosion, called by rockets spawned by BrainScream.
           Another RocketShot object will be spawned within a small distance
           of the one calling this pointer, and it will be given randomized
           z momentum, be transferred to frame S_BRAINEXPLODE1 (#799), and 
           have its frame's length randomly modified.
  Notes:   This effect will continue ad infinitum. This may slow the game
           down eventually, especially if multiple objects start this
           effect.


* SpawnFly
  Type:    Miscellaneous, normal
  Purpose: Boss spawn cube spawning function. If the spawn cube has not
           reached its target spot, which is judged by a precomputed amount
           of time having passed, nothing will occur. Otherwise, a 
           BossSpawnFire object will be spawned at the object's (x,y) location
           on the floor of its sector, the DSTELEPT sound will be played, and 
           one of the following monsters will be spawned at the same point, 
           with the approximate probability listed for that type:
           
                   Type     Probability   Type number (*)
           * DoomImp --------- 19.5% --------  1
           * Demon ----------- 15.6% --------  2
           * Spectre --------- 11.7% --------  3
           * Cacodemon ------- 11.7% --------  5
           * Mancubus -------- 11.7% --------  9
           * HellKnight ------  9.3% -------- 10
           * Arachnotron -----  7.8% --------  8
           * PainElemental ---  3.9% --------  4
           * Revenant --------  3.9% --------  7
           * BaronOfHell -----  3.9% -------- 11
           * Archvile --------  0.7% --------  6
           
           Friendliness of the spawn cube object will be transferred to the
           spawned monster. The spawned monster will telefrag anything
           occupying its location. The spawned monster will immediately
           awaken if it can either see a target, or a target has made sound
           in the area at any time in the past. The spawn cube object will
           remove itself after the spawning operation takes place.
  Notes:   Spawn cubes can occasionally miss their target. This is due to
           round-off error in the calculation used to determine the amount
           of time the cube should travel. If this happens, the cube will
           travel in a straight path for an undetermined amount of time.
           (*) -- This number indicates the order of the thing types in the
           EDF boss_spawner_types list. EDF allows the thing types spawned
           by this codepointer to be edited. See the <a href="edf_ref.html">EDF Reference</a>
           for more information.

                      
* Fire
  Type:    Miscellaneous, normal
  Purpose: Moves the object in front of the object it is tracing, if the
           object which it was spawned by has not lost sight of the traced
           object. This object must have been spawned by the VileAttack
           codepointer or no effects will occur.

           
* Spawn
  Type:    Miscellaneous, parameterized
  
  Parameter Information:
  * Unknown 1 = DeHackEd number of thing type to spawn 
                (must be valid, no default)
  * Unknown 2 = Integer amount of units to add to z coordinate of object 
                (default = 0)  
                
  Purpose: Spawns an object of the provided type at the calling object's
           location. Friendliness of the calling object will be transferred
           to the spawned object. This codepointer is new to MBF.
  Notes:   This codepointer will no longer crash on invalid thing type numbers
           as of Eternity Engine v3.31 public beta 3. If the type indicated is
           not valid, the pointer will do nothing. Also note that if both the 
           source and spawned object are solid, they will become stuck to each
           other. This codepointer is more suitable for boss-brain-like 
           effects.

           
* Turn
  Type:    Miscellaneous, parameterized
  
  Parameter Information:
  * Unknown 1 = Integer number of degrees to turn (default of 0 = 0 degrees)
  
  Purpose: The object will turn from its present angle the provided number
           of degrees. New to MBF.

           
* Face
  Type:    Miscellaneous, parameterized
  
  Parameter Information:
  * Unknown 1 = Integer angle to face (default of 0 = 0 degrees)
  
  Purpose: Makes the object face toward the indicated angle. New to MBF.
  Notes:   0 (zero) degrees is equivalent to east, or toward the right
           side of the automap.

  
* RandomJump
  Type:    Miscellaneous, parameterized
  
  Parameter Information:
  * Unknown 1 = Frame DeHackEd number to which object may jump 
                (default of 0 = frame 0)
  * Unknown 2 = Chance out of 256 that jump will occur (default of 0 = 0%)
  
  Purpose: Causes the object to transfer to the indicated frame with the
           indicated probability. If the jump does not occur, the object
           will fall through to the next frame. If the current frame's
           tics are set to -1, fall-through will not occur. New to MBF.
  Notes:   As of Eternity Engine v3.31 public beta 3, this codepointer
           will no longer crash the game if an invalid frame number is
           supplied. If the frame number is invalid, no jump will occur.


* HealthJump
  Type:    Miscellaneous, parameterized
  
  Parameter Information:
  * Args1 = Frame DeHackEd number to which object may jump
            (default of 0 = frame 0)
  * Args2 = Type of comparison to perform on object's health
            (default of 0 = 0)
            * 0 = Jump if health &lt; Args3
            * 1 = Jump if health &lt;= Args3
            * 2 = Jump if health &gt; Args3
            * 3 = Jump if health &gt;= Args3
            * 4 = Jump if health equals Args3
            * 5 = Jump if health does not equal Args3
            * 6 = Jump if health & Args3 (bitwise AND operation)
  * Args3 = Value to compare health against
            (default of 0 = 0)
  
  Purpose: Causes the object to transfer to the indicated frame if the
           value in Args3 compares as requested to the object's current
           health. This allows "frame scripting" of actions which vary
           depending on how much damage an enemy or other object has
           received. If the jump does not occur, the object will fall 
           through to the next frame. If the current frame's tics are 
           set to -1, fall-through will not occur. New to Eternity v3.31 
           public beta 7.
  Notes:   Option 6, "bitwise and", is most useful for performing an
           action only if the object's health is even or odd. To perform
           an action if the health value is odd, set Args3 to 1, and to
           perform an action if it is even, set Args3 to 2. Use of other
           values will result in periodic chances for an action, and
           will require experimentation.


* LineEffect
  Type:    Miscellaneous, parameterized
  
  Parameter Information:
  * Unknown 1 = Line special (default of 0 = 0)
  * Unknown 2 = Sector tag (default of 0 = 0)
  
  Purpose: Allows objects to trigger linedef specials from frames.
           This effect can trigger any W1/WR/S1/SR line effect. It does
           not work for G1/GR line effects. If a W1 or S1 line effect
           is triggered, the object will not be able to trigger any
           additional line effects. If the line special provided is not
           a valid type, nothing will occur. Note that the action will
           occur as if a player has activated the line, and not a
           monster. New to MBF.


* Stop
  Type:    Miscellaneous
  Purpose: Causes an object to completely stop all movement. New to Eternity.

* SpawnGlitter
  Type:    Miscellaneous, parameterized
  
  Parameter Information:
  * Args1 = DeHackEd number of object type to spawn (must be valid, no default)
  * Args2 = Fixed-point amount of z momentum to apply to object
            (default of 0 = +1/4 unit)
            
  Purpose: Teleport glitter spawning function. Can be used to make a fountain
           of any type of object. One object will be spawned at a randomized
           coordinate within a 32x32 square around the source object, and
           be given z momentum specified in Args2. If the thing type given
           in Args1 is invalid, this codepointer will do nothing.
           New to Eternity.


* AccelGlitter
  Type:    Miscellaneous, normal
  Purpose: Accelerates the object upward by increasing its z momentum by 50%
           New to Eternity.


* SpawnAbove
  Type:    Miscellaneous, parameterized
  
  Parameter Information:
  * Args1 = DeHackEd number of thing type to spawn (must be valid, no default)
  * Args2 = Frame DeHackEd number to which thing will transfer
            (default of 0 = 0, negative values = no frame transfer)
  * Args3 = Integer amount to add to thing's z coordinate 
            (default of 0 = 0 units)
  
  Purpose: Special spawning function to spawn an object above the source
           object. The object will be spawned at precisely the source's (x,y)
           position, and at the object's z coordinate plus the amount provided 
           in Args3. It will then be set to the frame specified by Args2, if 
           any. If the thing type in Args1 or the frame number in Args2 are 
           invalid, the pointer will do nothing. Note that a negative value can 
           be provided for the frame number to indicate that no frame
           transition is to take place. New to Eternity.


* MummySoul
  Type:    Miscellaneous, normal
  Purpose: Spawns a GolemSoul object 10 units above the object and gives it
           upward momentum of 1 unit. New to Eternity.


* BlueSpark
  Type:    Miscellaneous, normal
  Purpose: Spawns D'Sparil's blue projectile spark trail. Two DsparilSpark
           objects are spawned at the object's location and are given 
           randomized x, y, and z momenta. New to Eternity.


* GenWizard
  Type:    Miscellaneous, normal
  Purpose: DsparilShot2 Disciple spawning pointer. The pointer will attempt to 
           spawn a Disciple object at its (x,y) location and at its z minus 1/2 
           the height of a Disciple object. If after spawning, the object does 
           not fit or cannot move, it will be removed from the level immediate-
           ly. Otherwise, the MBF friendliness flag will be transferred from the
           source object to the new object, the source object will be stopped
           and set to its death state, a HereticTeleFog object will be spawned 
           at its location, and the Heretic TELEPT sound effect will be played.
           New to Eternity.


* Sor2DthInit
  Type:    Miscellaneous, normal
  Purpose: Part of D'Sparil (2nd form) death sequence. An internal field of the
           object will be set to 7 so that the death frame sequence loops 7
           times, and all living entities with the same friendliness as the
           dying object will be massacred (that is, if a friendly D'Sparil
           dies, all friends die, and if an enemy D'Sparil dies, all enemies
           die). New to Eternity.


* Sor2DthLoop
  Type:    Miscellaneous, normal
  Purpose: Part of D'Sparil (2nd form) death sequence. Each call to this
           codepointer decrements the internal field set by Sor2DthInit by
           one. If the field is still greater than zero, nothing will happen.
           Otherwise, the object will be transferred to the S_SOR2_DIE4
           frame and the death loop ends. New to Eternity.


* PodPain
  Type:    Miscellaneous, normal
  Purpose: Called when pods are damaged. There is a 50% chance that this
           codepointer will do nothing. Provided it takes action, there is
           a 16/256 chance that the codepointer will perform its action
           twice rather than once. Depending upon whether it chooses once
           or twice, it will spawn one or two PodGoo objects at the source
           object's (x,y) location and its z + 48 units. The objects will
           be given randomized momenta away from the pod. New to Eternity.


* RemovePod
  Type:    Miscellaneous, normal
  Purpose: Part of pod generator code, called when a pod is destroyed. This
           codepointer uses an internal field of the object to find the pod
           generator which spawned this pod. If that field is valid, it will
           decrement an internal field of the pod generator so that the
           generator will be able to spawn more pods in the future.


* MakePod
  Type:    Miscellaneous, normal
  Purpose: Part of pod generator code, called by pod generators to spawn pods.
           One of the object's internal fields is used to track the number of
           pods belonging to this generator. If that number is higher than 16,
           no more pods will be spawned (this limit is necessary to avoid
           overcrowding of areas with pods). Provided that there are not too
           many pods, the generator will attempt to create a new Pod object 
           at its location. If the generator's location is blocked by a solid 
           object, the pod will be removed immediately. Otherwise, the pod 
           object will transfer to the S_POD_GROW1 frame and will emit the
           Heretic NEWPOD sound effect. It will then be given random momenta,
           and one of its internal fields will be set to point back to the
           pod generator so that the generator can later be notified of the 
           pod's destruction. New to Eternity.


* DripBlood
  Type:    Miscellaneous, normal
  Purpose: A HereticBlood object will be spawned at a random location within a
           small distance of the source object, will be given randomized x and 
           y momenta, and will be given the LOGRAV Bits2 flag. New to Eternity.

<hr width="40%" align="left"></a>

* StartFire
  Type:    Miscellaneous / sound, normal
  Purpose: Plays the DSFLAMST sound and calls the Fire codepointer on the
           object. Part of the Archvile flame attack sequence.

           
* FireCrackle
  Type:    Miscellaneous / sound, normal
  Purpose: Plays the DSFLAME sound and calls the Fire codepointer on the
           object. Part of the Archvile flame attack sequence.

           
* SkelWhoosh
  Type:    Miscellaneous / sound, normal

* Sor1Pain
  Type:    Miscellaneous / sound, normal
  Purpose: An internal field of the object will be set to 20, so that it will
           walk faster when using the Sor1Chase codepointer. Control will then
           transfer to the Pain codepointer for normal pain sound playing.

<hr width="40%" align="left"></a>

* PlaySound
  Type:    Object sound pointer, parameterized
  
  Parameter Information:
  * Unknown 1 = Sound DeHackEd number to play (must be valid, no default)
  * Unknown 2 = Select sound volume
                * 0 = normal (default)
                * 1 = full volume
                
  Purpose: Causes the object to emit the sound indicated by the provided
           sound DeHackEd number, at the indicated volume level. New to MBF.
  Notes:   As of Eternity Engine v3.31 public beta 3, this codepointer will
           no longer crash the game if an invalid sound number is provided.
           If the sound number is invalid, nothing will happen.
           
           
* Pain
  Type:    Object sound pointer, normal
  Purpose: Plays the object's pain sound, if it has one.
  
  
* Scream
  Type:    Object sound pointer, normal
  Purpose: Plays the object's death sound, if it has one. If the object uses
           certain sounds as its death sound, it may play one of a set of
           random sounds as documented here:
           1) If the object uses any of the DSPODTH1, DSPODTH2, or DSPODTH3 
              sounds, it will play one of the three sounds at random.
           2) If the object uses either of the DSBGDTH1 or DSBGDTH2 sounds,
              it will play one of the two sounds at random.
           If the object has the BOSS flag in its Bits2 field, it will play
           its death sound at full volume. This is used by most DOOM and
           Heretic bosses.
  
  
* XScream
  Type:    Object sound pointer, normal
  Purpose: Plays the DSSLOP sound. If the object is a player, falling damage
           is active, and the player has died from falling, the DSFALLHT
           sound will be played (this sound is subject to remapping by
           player skins).


* PlayerScream
  Type:    Object sound pointer, normal
  Purpose: Plays player death sounds. Normally plays DSPLDETH sound. However,
           in games other than the shareware game, if the player dies with
           -50 or less health, it will play the DSPDIEHI sound. If Eternity's
           falling damage effect is active, and the player has died from
           falling, the DSFALLHT sound will be played. Note that all of these
           sounds are subject to remapping by player skins.


* BrainPain
  Type:    Object sound pointer, normal
  Purpose: Plays the DSBOSPN sound effect at full volume.


* BrainAwake
  Type:    Object sound pointer, normal
  Purpose: Plays the DSBOSSIT sound effect at full volume.
  Notes:   In DOOM, this codepointer was also responsible for initializing the
           internal list of Boss Spawn Spot objects. If the number of objects
           was incorrect, this code pointer could crash the game. However, this
           behavior has been moved, as of BOOM, to an internal level init
           function, and the limit on spawn spots has also been removed.

           
* VileStart
  Type:    Object sound pointer, normal
  Purpose: Plays the DSVILATK sound effect.

<a name="aiptr"><hr width="40%" align="left">
AI Pointers
<hr width="40%" align="left"></a>

* Look
  Type:    AI pointer, normal
  Purpose: Causes the object to look for targets. Various gameplay elements
           have an effect on acquiring a target. Friendly monsters will look
           for enemies first, but if they find none, will look for a player to
           follow. Enemies will look for players first, then friendly monsters.
           If none are found, they will remain asleep. Upon waking, a monster
           will play its alert sound. Use of certain alert sounds by a monster
           will cause it to randomly use one of a set of sounds, as documented
           here:
           1) If object uses the DSPOSIT1, DSPOSIT2, or DSPOSIT3 sounds, it
              will use any one of these three sounds at random.
           2) If object uses the DSBGSIT1 or DSBGSIT2 sounds, it will use one
              of these two sounds at random.
           If the object has the BOSS flag in its Bits2 field, it will play its
           alert sound at full-volume. This is used by most DOOM and Heretic
           bosses by default. After playing the sound, the object will transfer
           to its "first walking" state.
  Notes:   This codepointer should only be called from an object's initial
           spawn state. Calling it from a walking state can cause an infinite
           state cycle.
           
           
* Chase
  Type:    AI pointer, normal
  Purpose: Causes an object to pursue its target. If the object has lost its
           target (ie it has died or been removed), the object will look for
           a new target (possibly remembering a prior one). If no targets are
           found, the object will return to its initial spawn state. If the
           object has a target, it may attempt to attack. If an object has just 
           attacked prior to this, it will not attack again, unless the game 
           skill is at "Nightmare!" level or is in "fast" mode. Instead, the
           enemy will choose a new direction to walk in. If the object has a
           melee attack and is within 64 units of its target, it will transfer
           to its melee attack state. If the object does not have a melee
           attack or is not close enough to use it, is within normal missile
           range (2048 units), and timing or skill level permitting, it will
           transfer to its missile attack state. Depending on the actor's
           internal "threshold" value, which decrements slowly as it chases
           a target, it may choose a new target to attack when it cannot
           attack its current one. Friendly objects may choose a new player
           to follow, or may look for other friendly objects who are in
           critical condition (low health). If a friendly object finds a friend
           in trouble, it may adopt that friend's target as its own. Enemies
           will look for new players first, and then friendly monsters. If
           advanced strafing logic is active, and the monster is moving, it
           may decide to strafe away from its target. Once all moving and
           attack logic have been passed, the object has a 3/256 (1.17%) chance
           of playing its active (roaming) sound, if it has one. If an object
           has the ACTSEESOUND flag in its Bits3 field, it has a 50% chance of
           playing its alert sound instead of its active sound. If an object
           has the LOUDACTIVE flag in its Bits3 field, it will play which ever
           sound it chooses at full volume.
  Notes:   This codepointer should only be called from the walking frames of a
           sentient object. There may be undesired effects or undefined
           behavior in other circumstances.
           
           
* VileChase
  Type:    AI pointer, normal
  Purpose: Causes an object to look for monster corpses as it walks. When a
           corpse is encountered which has a resurrection state and is not
           currently blocked by any other creature, the object will stop
           beside it and transfer to frame #266 (S_VILE_HEAL). The object
           being resurrected will emit the DSSLOP sound and will be placed
           into its first resurrection frame. The resurrected object's
           normal height, radius, health, and flags information will be
           restored. Friendliness of the object performing the resurrection 
           will be transferred to the resurrected object (friendly objects 
           resurrect friends, and vice versa). If no corpses are found to 
           resurrect, control transfers to the Chase codepointer for normal 
           attack and walking logic.
  Notes:   If comp_vile is set, crushed creatures will not have their height
           or radius information restored, and will become "ghosts."
           

* FaceTarget
  Type:    AI pointer, normal
  Purpose: Makes an object face its target, if it has one. If the object's
           target is partially invisible (Bits field SHADOW), totally
           invisible (Bits2 field DONTDRAW), or a Heretic ghost (Bits3 field
           GHOST), the object will face toward the target, and then have a
           random amount between -45 and 45 degrees added to its angle.
           
           
* KeepChasing
  Type:    AI pointer, normal
  Purpose: Allows a monster to keep walking during its attack frames. Chase cannot
           be used in this context because it may cause the monster to acquire a 
           new target while trying to attack its current one. Note the monster's
           attack frames will need to have a short duration for the motion to seem
           smooth. New to Eternity.

Heretic AI Pointers
<hr width="40%" align="left"></a>

* Sor1Chase
  Type:    AI pointer, normal
  Purpose: D'Sparil first form walking logic. If an internal field of the object
           has been set to a positive value by the Sor1Pain codepointer, the object
           will subtract 3 from its current tics value, causing it to walk faster
           (its tics value will not be set less than 1, to avoid state cycles).
           The internal field will be decremented by 1. Control then transfers to
           the Chase codepointer for normal walking logic. New to Eternity.

  Type:    AI pointer / Walking sound, normal
  Purpose: The object will emit the DSMETAL sound effect, and then control
           will transfer to the Chase codepointer for normal walking and
           attack logic.
           
           
* BabyMetal
  Type:    AI pointer / Walking sound, normal
  Purpose: The object will emit the DSBSPWLK sound effect, and then control
           will transfer to the Chase codepointer for normal walking and
           attack logic.
           
           
* Hoof
  Type:    AI pointer / Walking sound, normal
  Purpose: The object will emit the DSHOOF sound effect, and then control 
           will transfer to the Chase codepointer for normal walking and

<a name="blast"><hr width="40%" align="left">
Blast Radius Attack Pointers
<hr width="40%" align="left"></a>

* Explode
  Type:    Blast radius attack, normal
  Purpose: Spawns a blast radius at the object's location 128 units in radius,
           with maximum damage of 128, decreasing linearly with distance from
           the blast point. If the blast radius is 128 units or closer to the
           floor, a TerrainTypes hit will occur.
           
           
* Detonate
  Type:    Blast radius attack, normal
  Purpose: Spawns a blast radius at the object's location with a radius
           and maximum damage value equal to the object's missile damage
           value. Other effects are the same as Explode. New to MBF.

* HticExplode
  Type:    Blast radius attack, parameterized
  
  Parameter Information:
  * Args1 = Select special explosion effect (default of 0 = 0)
            * 0 = Blast with radius and max damage of 128
            * 1 = D'Sparil blue spark effect
                  Radius and max damage = 80 + (rnd%32)
                  
  Purpose: Performs various Heretic explosion effects, selected by Args1.
           Higher argument values are reserved for addition of more effects
           and should not be used. If the blast radius is damage units or

Monster Attack Pointers
<hr width="40%" align="left"></a>

* PosAttack
  Type:    Monster attack, normal
  Purpose: Causes a Zombieman pistol attack. If the object's target is valid,
           it will turn to face it, play the DSPISTOL sound effect, and fire
           a single tracer with "monster" accuracy (very wide horizontal
           spread) for standard monster tracer damage of (rnd%5 + 1) * 3.


* SPosAttack
  Type:    Monster attack, normal
  Purpose: Causes a Sergeant shotgun attack. If the object's target is valid,
           it will turn to face it, play the DSSHOTGN sound effect, and fire
           3 tracers with "monster" accuracy for standard monster tracer
           damage of (rnd%5 + 1) * 3.


* VileTarget
  Type:    Monster attack, normal
  Purpose: Causes the object to face its target, and spawns a VileFire 
           object at the target's location. The Fire codepointer will be called
           on the VileFire object after it is spawned.


* VileAttack
  Type:    Monster attack, normal
  Purpose: If the object's target is valid and can currently be seen by the
           object, an Archvile explosion attack will occur. The object will
           face its target, emit the DSBAREXP sound, and damage the object
           directly for 20 points of damage. This attack will also impart
           an upward velocity to the target of (1000 / mass) units per tic.
           If the object has a currently spawned VileFire object, that object 
           will emit a blast radius of 70 units, with maximum damage of 70 at 
           the center of the explosion. This explosion can damage the attacking
           object if it is not immune to blast radius damage.

           
* SkelFist
  Type:    Monster attack, normal
  Purpose: If the object's target is valid and is within melee range
           (64 units) of the object, it will face its target, emit the 
           DSSKEPCH sound and damage its target directly for 
           (rnd%10 + 1) * 6 damage.

           
* SkelMissile
  Type:    Monster attack, Homing missile firing pointer, normal
  Purpose: If the object's target is valid, it will face toward it and fire
           a TracerShot missile at it. The missile's tracer target will be set
           the to the object it was fired at.
  Notes:   Missiles fired by this pointer will be fired 16 units higher than
           the normal default of 32 units.

           
* FatAttack1
  Type:    Monster attack, normal
  Purpose: If the object's target is valid, it will face it, and then turn an
           additional +11.25 degrees. It will fire two MancubusShot missiles, 
           one directly at the target, and another at +11.25 degrees.

           
* FatAttack2
  Type:    Monster attack, normal
  Purpose: If the object's target is valid, it will face it, and then turn an
           additional -11.25 degrees. It will fire two MancubusShot missiles, 
           one directly at the target, and another at -11.25 degrees.

           
* FatAttack3
  Type:    Monster attack normal
  Purpose: If the object's target is valid, it will face it and fire two
           MancubusShot missiles, one at its angle plus 5.625 degrees, and
           the other at its angle minus 5.625 degrees.


* CPosAttack
  Type:    Monster attack, normal
  Purpose: Causes a Chaingunner chaingun attack. If the object's target is 
           valid, it will turn to face it, play the DSCHGUN sound effect, and
           fire a single tracer with "monster" accuracy (very wide horizontal
           spread) for standard monster tracer damage of (rnd%5 + 1) * 3.

           
* TroopAttack
  Type:    Monster attack, normal
  Purpose: Imp attack codepointer. If the object's target is valid, it will
           face toward it. If the target is within melee range (64 units) of
           the object, the object will emit the DSCLAW sound effect and damage
           the target directly for (rnd%8 + 1) * 3 damage. Otherwise, the
           object will fire a DoomImpShot projectile at the target.

           
* SargAttack
  Type:    Monster attack, normal
  Purpose: Demon attack codepointer. If the object's target is valid and is
           within melee range (64 units) of the target, it will face the
           target and damage it directly for (rnd%10 + 1) * 4 damage.

           
* HeadAttack
  Type:    Monster attack, normal
  Purpose: Cacodemon attack codepointer. If the object's target is valid, it
           will face toward it. If the target is within melee range (64 units)
           of the object, the object will damage the target directly for
           (rnd%6 + 1) * 10 damage. Otherwise, the object will fire a
           CacodemonShot projectile at the target.

           
* BruisAttack
  Type:    Monster attack, normal
  Purpose: Baron attack codepointer. If the object's target is valid, it will
           face toward it. If the target is within melee range (64 units) of
           the object, the object will emit the DSCLAW sound effect, and will
           damage the target directly for (rnd%8 + 1) * 10 damage. Otherwise,
           the object will fire a BaronShot projectile at the target.

           
* SkullAttack
  Type:    Monster attack, normal
  Purpose: Lost soul attack codepointer. If the object's target is valid, it
           will face toward it and, if it has an attack sound, will emit it.
           The object's SKULLFLY Bits flag will be set, and it will hurdle
           toward its target at a speed of 20 units per second.
  Notes:   Eternity will not crash if an object with no attack sound uses
           this codepointer. This was a common problem in earlier ports.

           
* BspiAttack
  Type:    Monster attack, normal
  Purpose: Arachnotron attack codepointer. If the object's target is valid,
           it will face toward it and fire one ArachnotronShot projectile.

           
* CyberAttack
  Type:    Monster attack, normal
  Purpose: Cyberdemon attack codepointer. If the object's target is valid,
           it will face toward it and fire one RocketShot projectile.

           
* PainAttack
  Type:    Monster attack, normal
  Purpose: Pain Elemental attack codepointer. If the object's target is valid,
           it will face toward it. If the comp_pain variable is asserted, the
           monster will check the number of lost souls on the level. If that 
           number is higher than 20, no attack will occur. If the flag is not
           set, there is no limitation. The monster will then spawn one lost
           soul immediately in front of it and face it toward its own target.
           If the comp_skull variable is off, the lost soul will be destroyed
           immediately if it is spawned over a blocking line. The lost soul's
           target will be set equal to the monster's, and then the SkullAttack
           codepointer will be called on it such that it performs a lost soul
           attack.
  Notes:   The MBF friendliness flag's state is transferred to the spawned
           lost soul. Friendly Pain Elementals shoot friendly lost souls;
           enemy PE's fire enemies.

                      
* BrainSpit
  Type:    Monster attack, normal
  Purpose: Boss brain spawn cube attack. If there are no boss spawn spots on
           the level, this function will do nothing. If the game is on the
           an easy skill level, this function will do nothing on every other
           call. Otherwise, a boss spawn spot will be selected by its map
           spawning order, and a BossSpawnCube object will be fired at it like
           a missile. The object will then emit the DSBOSPIT sound effect.
  Notes:   The MBF friendliness flag will be transferred to the spawn cube
           from the firing object. This is so that the cube will later
           spawn either an enemy or friendly monster, depending on the
           friendliness of its originating boss brain.

  Type:    Monster attack, parameterized
  
  Parameter Information:
  * Unknown 1 = Amount of damage to inflict (default of 0 = 0)
  * Unknown 2 = DeHackEd number of sound to play 
                (default of 0 = no sound will be played)
  
  Purpose: If the object's target is valid and is within melee range
           (64 units), it will damage the target for the indicated amount.
           If the Unknown 2 parameter is non-zero and is a valid sound
           DeHacked number, the indicated sound will played along with the
           attack. New to MBF.
  Notes:   As of Eternity Engine v3.31 public beta 3, this codepointer will
           no longer crash the game if an invalid sound number is provided.
           No sound will be played if the number is invalid.
           
        
* MissileAttack
  Type:    Monster attack, Homing missile firing pointer, parameterized
  
  Parameter Information:
  * Args1 = DeHackEd number of thing type to fire (no default, must be valid)
  * Args2 = Select homing property (default of 0 = 0)
            * 0 = will not home
            * 1 = may home
  * Args3 = Amount to add to standard z missile firing height (32 units)
            (default of 0 = 0, can be negative)
  * Args4 = Amount to add to actor angle in degrees
            (default of 0 = 0, can be negative)
  * Args5 = DeHackEd number of state to enter for optional melee attack
            (default of 0 = 0, negative values = no melee attack)
            
  Purpose: Very powerful parameterized monster projectile attack pointer. Can
           be used to create standard attacks or angular spreads, with or
           without homing.  Can fire missiles at a customized height, and can
           optionally chain to another state when the object is within melee
           range of its target, allowing situational attacks like those used
           by the Imp, Baron, and Cacodemon.  The Args5 parameter should be 
           set to -1 unless a valid frame DeHackEd number is provided.
           New to Eternity Engine v3.31 public beta 4.
  Notes:   Missiles must have a homing maintenance pointer in their frames in
           order to home.

           
* MissileSpread
  Type:    Monster attack, parameterized
  
  Parameter Information:
  * Args1 = DeHackEd number of thing type to fire (no default, must be valid)
  * Args2 = Number of missiles to fire (MUST be greater than or equal to 2)
  * Args3 = Amount to add to standard z missile firing height (32 units)
            (default of 0 = 0, can be negative)
  * Args4 = Total angular sweep of attack in degrees
            (default of 0 = 0)
  * Args5 = DeHackEd number of state to enter for optional melee attack
            (default of 0 = 0, negative values = no melee attack)
  
  Purpose: Convenience codepointer for firing a barrage of missiles in an
           angular sweep. The object will face its target and begin firing
           missiles at its angle minus half the Args4 sweep value. It will
           then step Args4 / (Args2 - 1) degrees for each additional missile,
           spreading them out evenly, centered on the actor's angle. Thus, the 
           angular sweep is the total separation between the first and last 
           missiles in degrees. This codepointer can only be used to fire 2 or 
           more missiles. Providing a value of 0 or 1 will cause it to stop 
           without attacking. The Args5 parameter can be used to specify a 
           frame to use for an optional melee attack, used when the object is
           within melee range of its target. This parameter should be set to 
           -1 unless a valid frame DeHackEd number is provided. 
           New to Eternity Engine v3.31 public beta 6.
           

* BulletAttack
  Type:    Monster attack, parameterized
  
  Parameter Information:
  * Args1 = DeHackEd number of sound to play (default of 0 = no sound)
  * Args2 = Select accuracy (default of 0 = 1)
            * 1 = Always accurate
            * 2 = Never accurate
                  (moderate horizontal spread with no vertical error)
            * 3 = Super Shotgun accuracy
                  (wide horizontal spread with moderate vertical error)
            * 4 = Monster accuracy (very wide horizontal spread)
  * Args3 = Number of bullet tracers to fire (default of 0 = 0)
  * Args4 = Damage factor (Damage formula is: dmgfactor * ((rnd%dmgmod) + 1))
  * Args5 = Damage modulus
            (Forced into range of 1 to 256)
  
  Purpose: Powerful codepointer which allows construction of custom monster
           bullet attacks. This pointer is capable of emulating any of the
           built-in player or monster bullet attacks, as well creating many
           completely new ones (including a super shotgun attack for
           monsters). New to Eternity Engine v3.31 public beta 6.
  Notes:   The Args2 parameter for this pointer differs slightly from the
           Args2 parameter to the FireCustomBullets player codepointer. The
           value which allows "first fire only" accuracy is not available 
           for monsters.

Heretic Monster Attack Pointers
<hr width="40%" align="left"></a>

* MummyAttack
  Type:    Heretic monster attack, normal
  Purpose: Golem attack. If the object's target is invalid, nothing will occur. 
           Otherwise, it will emit its attack sound if it has one. If its 
           target is within melee range (64 units), it will damage its target 
           directly for (rnd%8 + 1) * 2 damage, and play the MUMAT2 sound 
           effect. If the target was not within melee range, no attack occurs 
           and the MUMAT1 sound effect is played. New to Eternity.


* MummyAttack2
  Type:    Heretic monster attack, Homing missile firing pointer, normal
  Purpose: Golem Leader attack. If the object's target is invalid, nothing 
           will occur. Otherwise, if the object's target is within melee range 
           (64 units), it will receive direct damage for (rnd%8 + 1) * 2 HP.
           Otherwise, a GolemShot projectile will be fired at the target, and
           will be set to home on it. New to Eternity.


* ClinkAttack
  Type:    Heretic monster attack, normal
  Purpose: Sabreclaw attack. If the object's target is invalid, nothing will
           occur. Otherwise, the object will play its attack sound if it
           has one. If the object's target is within melee range (64 units),
           it will be damaged directly for (rnd%7 + 3) points. New to Eternity.
           
* WizardAtk1
  Type:    Heretic monster attack, normal
  Purpose: Disciple attack. The object will face its target and turn off the
           GHOST Bits3 flag. New to Eternity.
           
   
* WizardAtk2
  Type:    Heretic monster attack, normal
  Purpose: Disciple attack. The object will face its target and turn on the
           GHOST Bits3 flag. New to Eternity.
           
           
* WizardAtk3
  Type:    Heretic monster attack, normal
  Purpose: The object will turn off the GHOST Bits3 flag. If its target is
           invalid, nothing further will be done. Otherwise, the object will
           play its attack sound if it has one. If the target is within
           melee range (64 units), it will be damaged directly for
           (rnd%8 + 1) * 4 points. Otherwise, 3 DiscipleShot projectiles will 
           be fired, one directly ahead, and the other two 5.625 degrees to 
           the left and right. New to Eternity.


* Srcr2Decide
  Type:    Heretic monster attack, normal
  Purpose: D'Sparil (2nd form) teleportation pointer. D'Sparil teleports more
           and more as his life is lower. The exact probability formula is
           complicated, but is 192/256 at maximum. When D'Sparil teleports,
           a DsparilTeleSpot object is chosen at random as a destination. 
           D'Sparil transfers to the S_SOR2_TELE1 frame and is teleported to 
           the destination spot. A DsparilTeleFade object (which by default 
           looks like D'Sparil himself) is spawned at his original location, 
           and the Heretic TELEPT sound is played at both locations.
           New to Eternity.


* Srcr2Attack
  Type:    Heretic monster attack, normal
  Purpose: D'Sparil (2nd form) attack pointer. If the object's target is
           invalid, nothing will occur. Otherwise, the object's attack sound
           will be played if it has one. If the target is within melee
           range, the target will be damaged directly for (rnd%8 + 1) * 20
           points. Otherwise, one of two missile attacks will occur. The
           chance of the first attack, Disciple spawning, is dependent upon
           the object's health. If its current health is half or more of its
           spawn health, then the chance is 48/256. If it is less than half,
           the chance increases to 96/256. If Disciple spawning is chosen,
           two DsparilShot2 projectiles will be spawned at the object's angle
           plus and minus 45 degrees, and the MBF friendliness flag is
           transferred to the projectiles so that they spawn Disciples with
           the same friendliness. If Disciple spawning is not chosen, a
           DsparilShot1 projectile will be fired at the target.
           New to Eternity.


* KnightAttack
  Type:    Heretic monster attack, normal
  Purpose: Heretic Death Knight attack. If the object's target is invalid, 
           nothing will occur. If the object's target is within melee range 
           (64 units), it will be hit directly for (rnd%8 + 1) * 3 damage, and
           the object will emit the Heretic KGTAT2 sound effect. Otherwise, the 
           object will emit its attack sound, if it has one, and one of two
           projectiles will be fired. If the object using this pointer is a
           DeathKnightGhost object, KnightAxeRed will always be thrown. 
           Otherwise, there is a 40/256 chance that KnightAxeRed will be 
           thrown. If KnightAxeRed is not thrown, KnightAxe will be thrown 
           instead. New to Eternity.


* BeastAttack
  Type:    Heretic monster attack, normal
  Purpose: Heretic Weredragon attack. If the object's target is invalid, 
           nothing will occur. Otherwise, the object will emit its attacksound,
           if it has one. Then, if the target is within melee range (64 units),
           it will be hit directly for (rnd%8 + 1) * 3 damage. If the target is
           further away, a WeredragonShot missile will be fired at it.
           New to Eternity.


* BeastPuff
  Type:    Heretic monster attack, normal
  Purpose: Spawns damaging smoke trail behind WeredragonShot projectiles. There
           is a 64/256 chance that no action will be taken. Provided that 
           action is taken, a WeredragonSmoke object will be spawned within a 
           small random distance of the source object and will be marked as if
           though it was fired by the object who fired the source object. This 
           prevents the source object from taking damage, and properly credits
           it with any kill. New to Eternity.
           
           
* SnakeAttack
  Type:    Heretic monster attack, normal
  Purpose: Ophidian attack 1. If the object's target is invalid, the object will
           be set to its seestate. Otherwise, the object will emit its attack
           sound, if it has one, will face its target, and will fire one
           OphidianShotA missile. New to Eternity.
  
  
* SnakeAttack2
  Type:    Heretic monster attack, normal
  Purpose: Ophidian attack 2. If the object's target is invalid, the object will
           be set to its seestate. Otherwise, the object will emit its attack
           sound, if it has one, will face its target, and will fire one
           OphidianShotB missile. New to Eternity.
  
  
* Srcr1Attack
  Type:    Heretic monster attack, normal
  Purpose: D'Sparil first form attack. If the object's target is invalid, 
           nothing will occur. Otherwise the object will play its attack sound,
           if it has one. If the object is within melee range of the target, it
           will damage the target directly for ((rnd % 8) + 1) * 8 damage. 
           Otherwise, it will decide on a missile attack.  If the object has
           more than 66% of its spawn health, it will fire one SRDsparilShot1
           missile. Otherwise, it will fire three SRDsparilShot1 missiles, one
           straight ahead and the other two at +/- 3 degrees from its angle. 
           Additionally, if the thing's health is less than 33% of its spawn
           health, and it has not just attacked before, it will transfer to 
           frame S_SRCR1_ATK4 in order to attack again. New to Eternity.

Homing Missile Maintenance Pointers
<hr width="40%" align="left"></a>

* Tracer
  Type:    Homing missile maintenance pointer, normal
  Purpose: Performs homing maintenance for Revenant missiles. If the missile
           was fired by a homing-missile-firing codepointer, it may home on its
           target. However, this pointer will cause the missile to fail to
           home depending upon the gametic at which it is called. If the 
           gametic is not divisible by 3, no actions will occur. Otherwise, one
           BulletPuff and one TracerSmoke object will be spawned behind the 
           missile, the TracerSmoke object will be given upward momentum, and 
           the missile will home on its target.
  Notes:   As mentioned above, missiles do not always home when using this
           codepointer. Also, missiles must be fired by a homing-missile-
           firing codepointer or else no homing will take place.
           

* GenTracer
  Type:    Homing missile maintenance pointer, normal
  Purpose: Performs generic homing maintenance. If a missile was fired by a
           homing-missile-firing codepointer, it will home on its target. No
           other special effects will occur. New to Eternity.

Heretic Homing Missile Maintenance Pointers

* HticTracer
  Type:    Homing missile maintenance pointer, parameterized
  
  Parameter Information:
  * Args1 = Threshold angle, integer
  * Args2 = Max turn angle, integer
  
  Purpose: Performs Heretic-style homing missile maintenance. The threshold
           and max turn parameters affect when the missile will home and how
           far at maximum that it can turn, respectively. Different monsters
           use different values for these, and they can feasibly be set to
           any value from 0 to 359 degrees. Vertical adjustment of Heretic-
           style homing missiles is very conservative. Vertical momentum will
           only be adjusted if the missile is outside the height range of its
           target. As a result, the missile can hit the ground easily.

* CPosRefire
  Type:    Line of sight checking pointer, normal
  Purpose: Checks the line of sight between the attacking object and its
           target. If the line has been blocked, the object will transfer back 
           to its first walking frame. If the object is friendly and has hit a 
           friend by accident, it may stop firing. If the object is friendly 
           and is retaliating against a friend's attack, it will fire only a 
           small, random number of shots before stopping.
           
           
* SpidRefire
  Type:    Line of sight checking pointer, normal
  Purpose: Checks the line of sight between the attacking object and its
           target. If the line has been blocked, the object will transfer back 
           to its first walking frame. If the object is friendly and has hit a 
           friend by accident, it may stop firing. If the object is friendly

  Type:    Monster death / attack, normal
  Purpose: The Fall codepointer will be called on the object, and then it will
           perform 3 consecutive Lost Soul spawnings following the same
           procedure as that of the PainAttack codepointer, but each at a
           different angle.
           
           
* KeenDie
  Type:    Monster death / "Magic" codepointer, normal
  Purpose: The Fall codepointer will be called on the object. It will then
           check the level to see if all objects of the type which called
           this pointer are dead. If so, all sectors tagged 666 will be

  Type:    "Magic" codepointer, normal
  Purpose: Causes a normal exit from the level.
  Notes:   This pointer does not check for other boss brain objects, nor does
           it check to make sure that players are still alive before exiting
           the level. As such, players may become zombies if this pointer is

           cheat is activated by the player. The Fall codepointer is called on
           the object, and then it is set to state S_SRCR1_DIE17 using an
           internal function which causes the codepointer for that state to
           not be called. This prevents spawning of D'Sparil's second form.
           Specified via EDF only. New to Eternity.<!-- TODO: LINK! -->
