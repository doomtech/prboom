    <h1>Installation on Linux and UNIX Systems</h1>

    <p> This page guides you through the first steps of getting
    PrBoom, namely downloading the right PrBoom package for your
    system, and getting the necessary libraries.</p>

    <p> Please see the most appropriate instructions depending on
    your system distribution:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><a href="#redhat">Linux/x86 RPM based distros</a>
      (Redhat, Mandrake, ...)</li>

      <li><a href="#debian">Debian</a> (and derivatives)</li>

      <li><a href="#freebsd">FreeBSD</a> (may be appropriate for
      other BSDs)</li>

      <li><a href="#unix">Generic UNIX</a> (anything else)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>If you want music support, see the <a href="#timidity">music
    section</a>.</p>

    <h2>Compiling with OpenGL support</h2>

    <p> I didn't write the OpenGL stuff, nor do I have a good 3D
    card to test with, so I don't use this nor know much about it.
    That said, it did work for me last time I tried it.</p>

    <p> The RPM distribution of PrBoom doesn't support this, so you
    must compile from source. Follow the instructions below
    relevant to your distribution, but add the parameter <code>
    --enable-gl</code> when you run <code>configure</code>. You'll
    need Mesa installed.</p>

    <p>I don't suggest using the OpenGL stuff unless you're already
    familiar with Doom and PrBoom.</p>

    <p>We got reports that it works with XFree 4.x</p>
    <!-- cph - perhaps Jess should write some stuff here - I know nothing ;-) -->

    <h2><a id="redhat" name="redhat">Linux/x86 RPM based
    distributions</a></h2>

    <p> We test and recommend the following RPM's to use with
    PrBoom:</p>

    <ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.libsdl.org/release/SDL-1.2.0-1.i386.rpm">SDL-1.2.0-1.i386.rpm</a>.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_mixer/release/SDL_mixer-1.2.0-1.i386.rpm">SDL_mixer-1.2.0-1.i386.rpm</a>.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_net/release/SDL_net-1.2.0-1.i386.rpm">SDL_net-1.2.0-1.i386.rpm</a>.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>To install these, you use <code>rpm</code>. E.g. if you
    downloaded all of the above RPMs into one directory, <code>
    cd</code> to that directory and run <code>rpm -ivh
    *.rpm</code>. You can then run PrBoom as <code>
    /usr/games/prboom</code>.</p>

    <p> Notes:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
      If you're a Mandrake user, you can't any more just use the SDL version
      shipped with Mandrake (Mandrake 8.0 only ships with SDL-1.1 I believe).
      I'm sure the next Mandrake release will catch up though.
      </li>

      <li>There may be newer versions of some of these libraries
      available from their websites;
      anything in the 1.2 series should work fine, let us know if not.
      </li>

      <li>If you are using a partiularly stripped down setup, you
      might need to install a few more RPMs required by these ones.
      They should be on your distribution CDs.</li>

      <li>No source RPM (SRPM) is provided for PrBoom. The RPM is
      built from the source tarball unmodified: see the <code>
      INSTALL</code> file in the source tarball for details.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2><a id="debian" name="debian">Debian</a></h2>

    <p> Debian unstable contains a <a
    href="http://packages.debian.org/prboom">packaged version of
    PrBoom</a>, which should be fairly up-to-date.</p>

    <p> Alteratively, you can build the latest PrBoom from source
    on Debian very easily. Install the <a
    href="http://packages.debian.org/libsdl1.2">libsdl1.2</a>, <a
    href="http://packages.debian.org/libsdl-mixer1.2">
    libsdl-mixer1.2</a> and <a
    href="http://packages.debian.org/libsdl-net1.2">
    libsdl-net1.2</a> packages and the corresponding -dev versions
    - these are all available in Debian woody and above (and should
    compile from source fine for potato). Get the prboom source
    code <code>prboom-2.2.1.tar.gz</code> from our <a
    href="#download">download page</a>, extract, and then follow
    the included <code>INSTALL</code> instructions.</p>

    <h2><a id="freebsd" name="freebsd">FreeBSD</a></h2>

    <p> I've tested on FreeBSD 4.1-STABLE. The ports tree contains
    packages of most of the stuff you need. Make the following
    ports:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>devel/sdl-devel</li>

      <li>audio/sdl_mixer (requires audio/smpeg)</li>
    </ul>

    <p> You also need the SDL_net library, which you can get from
    <a href="http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_net/">it's
    homepage</a>. Note that because the sdl-devel port installs in
    a strange directory, you'll need to <code>ln -s
    ../SDL/SDL_net.h /usr/local/include/SDL11/SDL_net.h</code> or
    something similar.</p>

    <p> Finally, get <code>prboom-2.2.1.tar.gz</code> the PrBoom
    source, extract, and follow the included <code>INSTALL</code>
    instructions.</p>

    <h2><a id="unix" name="unix">Generic UNIX</a></h2>

    <p> You need to get and install the following libraries:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>SDL 1.2.x, from <a
      href="http://www.libsdl.org/download-1.2.html">the SDL 1.2
      download page</a>.</li>

      <li>
        SDL_mixer, from <a
        href="http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_mixer/">its home
        page</a>. This also requires the following: 

        <ul>
          <li>SMPEG, from <a
          href="http://www.lokigames.com/development/smpeg.php3">
          the SMPEG homepage</a>.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>I don't know about these, look 'em up yourself :-).</p>
      </li>

      <li>SDL_net, from <a
      href="http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_net/">its home
      page</a>.</li>
    </ul>

    <p> Then get <code>prboom-2.2.1.tar.gz</code> the PrBoom
    source, extract, and follow the included <code>INSTALL</code>
    instructions.</p>

    <h2><a id="download" name="download">Download page</a></h2>

    <p>Is <a
    href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=3396">
    here</a>. It's possible that the version numbers on this page
    may not be up to date. You can figure it out :-).</p>

    <h2><a id="timidity" name="timidity">Music</a></h2>

    <p> The SDL_mixer library used by PrBoom supports software MIDI
    music synthesis. If you want to hear the Doom music, you need a
    set of Timidity instrument patches. Debian includes a package
    <code>timidity-patches</code> which provides these. People with
    RPM based systems can <a
    href="http://rpmfind.net/linux/RPM/timidity-instruments.html">
    look for a package</a>. Really good but quite big are the <a
    href="http://www.stardate.bc.ca/eawpatches/html/default.htm">
    Eawpatches</a>. Everyone else, do a web search for timidity
    patch sets, there are plenty around.</p>

    <p>These patch sets are a large download (&gt;5megs).</p>

    <p> SDL_mixer does not currently support hardware MIDI
    synthesis. We plan to nag the SDL developers about this. If you
    want it, you nag them too :-).</p>
