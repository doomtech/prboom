<h1>Installation on Linux and UNIX Systems</h1>
<p>
 This page guides you through the first steps of getting PrBoom, namely
 downloading the right PrBoom package for your system, and getting the
 necessary libraries.
</p><p>
 Please see the most appropriate instructions depending on your
 system distribution:
</p><ul>
 <li><a href="#redhat">Linux/x86 RPM based distros</a> (Redhat, Mandrake, ...)</li>
 <li><a href="#debian">Debian</a> (and derivatives)</li>
 <li><a href="#freebsd">FreeBSD</a> (may be appropriate for other BSDs)</li>
 <li><a href="#unix">Generic UNIX</a> (anything else)</li>
</ul>
<p>If you want music support, see the <a href="#timidity">music section</a>.</p>
<h2>Compiling with OpenGL support</h2>
 <p>
  I didn't write the OpenGL stuff, nor do I have a good 3D card to test with,
  so I don't use this nor know much about it. That said, it did work for me
  last time I tried it.
 </p><p>
  The RPM distribution of PrBoom doesn't support this, so you must compile
  from source. Follow the instructions below relevant to your distribution,
  but add the parameter <code>--enable-gl</code> when you run
  <code>configure</code>. You'll need Mesa installed.</p>
 <p>I don't suggest using the OpenGL stuff unless you're already familiar
  with Doom and PrBoom.</p>
 <p>We got reports that it works with XFree 4.x</p>
<!-- cph - perhaps Jess should write some stuff here - I know nothing ;-) -->
 </p>
<h2><a name="redhat">Linux/x86 RPM based distributions</a></h2>
 <p>
  We test and recommend the following RPM's to use with PrBoom:
 </p><ul>
  <li><a href="http://mirror.uklinux.net/mandrake/7.2/i586/Mandrake/RPMS/SDL-1.1.4-7mdk.i586.rpm>http://mirror.uklinux.net/mandrake/7.2/i586/Mandrake/RPMS/SDL-1.1.4-7mdk.i586.rpm</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://mirror.uklinux.net/mandrake/7.2/i586/Mandrake/RPMS/SDL_mixer-1.0.6-2mdk.i586.rpm">http://mirror.uklinux.net/mandrake/7.2/i586/Mandrake/RPMS/SDL_mixer-1.0.6-2mdk.i586.rpm</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://mirror.uklinux.net/mandrake/7.2/i586/Mandrake/RPMS/SDL_net-1.1.1-1mdk.i586.rpm">http://mirror.uklinux.net/mandrake/7.2/i586/Mandrake/RPMS/SDL_net-1.1.1-1mdk.i586.rpm</a></li>
 </ul>
 <p>To install these, you use <code>rpm</code>. E.g. if you downloaded all
  of the above RPMs into one directory, <code>cd</code> to that directory
  and run <code>rpm -ivh <code>*.rpm</code>. You can then run PrBoom as
  <code>/usr/games/prboom</code>.
 </p><p>
  Notes:
 </p><ul>
  <li>
   You no longer need the smpeg library to use PrBoom. PrBoom itself has 
   never used smpeg, but the SDL RPM's we used to recommend needed it.
  </li><li>
   The RPMs we recommend are those shipped with Mandrake 7.2. If you're a 
   Mandrake user, you already have them, and they were installed by default 
   if you selected a workstation setup (at least, they were here...). If not, 
   you can install them off the Mandrake CDs.
  </li><li>
   There are newer versions of some of these libraries available from their 
   respective homepages. It's generally OK to use these. The main exception is 
   SDL_mixer... the latest upstream RPMs have (needlessly) changed the soname 
   of the library, rendering their new RPMs useless. Use the Mandrake one 
   we recommend.
  </li><li>
   If you are using a partiularly stripped down setup, you might need to 
   install a few more RPMs required by these ones. They should be on your 
   CDs.
  </li>
 </ul>
<h2><a name="debian">Debian</a></h2>
 <p>
  Debian unstable contains packages of SDL and SDL_mixer. First, install
   the packages <code>libsdl1.1, libsdl1.1-dev, libsdl-mixer1.0,
   libsdl-mixer-dev, smpeg</code>.
   You also need the SDL_net library, which is not
   yet packaged for Debian; get the source from
   <a href="http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_net/">the SDL_net homepage</a>.
   Get the prboom source code <code>prboom-2.1.1.tar.gz</code> from our
   <a href="#download">download page</a>, extract, and then follow the
   included <code>INSTALL</code> instructions.</dd>
 </p><p>
  Joe Drew, the maintainer of LxDoom in Debian, is working on packages of 
  PrBoom for Debian.
 </p>
<h2><a name="freebsd">FreeBSD</a></h2>
 <p>
  I've tested on FreeBSD 4.1-STABLE. The ports tree contains packages
   of most of the stuff you need. Make the following ports:
 </p></ul>
  <li>devel/sdl-devel</li>
  <li>audio/sdl_mixer (requires audio/smpeg)</li>
 </ul><p>
   You also need the SDL_net library, which you can get from
   <a href="http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_net/">it's homepage</a>.
   Note that because the sdl-devel port installs in a strange directory,
   you'll need to
   <code>ln -s ../SDL/SDL_net.h /usr/local/include/SDL11/SDL_net.h</code>
   or something similar.
 </p><p>
  Finally, get <code>prboom-2.1.1.tar.gz</code> the PrBoom source, extract,
  and follow the included <code>INSTALL</code> instructions.
 </p>
<h2><a name="unix">Generic UNIX</a></h2>
 <p>
  You need to get and install the following libraries:
 </p><ul>
  <li>SDL 1.1.x, from <a href="http://www.libsdl.org/download-1.1.html">the
   SDL 1.1 download page</a>.</li>
  <li>SDL_mixer, from <a href="http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_mixer/">its
   home page</a>. This also requires the following:
   <ul>
    <li>SMPEG, from <a href="http://www.lokigames.com/development/smpeg.php3">the SMPEG homepage</a>.</li>
   </ul>
   <p>I don't know about these, look 'em up yourself :-).</p>
  </li>
  <li>SDL_net, from <a href="http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_net/">its home
   page</a>.</li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  Then get <code>prboom-2.1.1.tar.gz</code> the PrBoom source, extract,
  and follow the included <code>INSTALL</code> instructions.
 </p>
<h2><a name="download">Download page</h2>
 <p>Is <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=3396">here</a>. It's possible that the version numbers on this page may not be up to date. You can figure it out :-).</p>
<h2><a name="timidity">Music</a></h2>
 <p>
  The SDL_mixer library used by PrBoom supports software MIDI music synthesis.
  If you want to hear the Doom music, you need a set of Timidity
  instrument patches.
  Debian includes a package <code>timidity-patches</code> which provides
  these. People with RPM based systems can
  <a href="http://rpmfind.net/linux/RPM/timidity-instruments.html">look
  for a package</a>. Everyone else, do a web search for timidity patch sets,
  there are plenty around.
 </p>
 <note>These patch sets are a large download (>5megs).</note>
 <p>
  SDL_mixer does not currently support hardware MIDI synthesis. We plan to nag
  the SDL developers about this. If you want it, you nag them too :-).
