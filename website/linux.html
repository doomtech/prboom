<h1>Installation on Linux and UNIX Systems</h1>
<p>
 This page guides you through the first steps of getting PrBoom, namely
 downloading the right PrBoom package for your system, and getting the
 necessary libraries.
</p><p>
 Please see the most appropriate instructions depending on your
 system distribution:
</p><ul>
 <li><a href="#redhat">Linux/x86 RPM based distros</a> (Redhat, Mandrake, ...)</li>
 <li><a href="#debian">Debian</a> (and derivatives)</li>
 <li><a href="#freebsd">FreeBSD</a> (may be appropriate for other BSDs)</li>
 <li><a href="#unix">Generic UNIX</a> (anything else)</li>
</ul>
<p>If you want music support, see the <a href="#timidity">music section</a>.</p>
<h2>Compiling with OpenGL support</h2>
 <p>
  I didn't write the OpenGL stuff, nor do I have a good 3D card to test with,
  so I don't use this nor know much about it. That said, it did work for me
  last time I tried it.
 </p><p>
  The RPM distribution of PrBoom doesn't support this, so you must compile
  from source. Follow the instructions below relevant to your distribution,
  but add the parameter <code>--enable-gl</code> when you run
  <code>configure</code>. You'll need Mesa installed.</p>
 <p>I don't suggest using the OpenGL stuff unless you're already familiar
  with Doom and PrBoom.</p>
 <p><code>We got reports that it works with XFree 4.x</code></p>
<!-- cph - perhaps Jess should write some stuff here - I know nothing ;-) -->
 </p>
<h2><a name="redhat">Linux/x86 RPM based distributions</a></h2>
 <p>
  You need to download the following things:
 </p><ul>
  <li>The main SDL library, <code>SDL-1.1.4-1.i386.rpm</code> (or a later version),
   from <a href="http://www.libsdl.org/download-1.1.html">the SDL 1.1
   download page</a>.</li>
  <li>smpeg, from <code>smpeg-0.3.5-1.i386.rpm</code> or later from
   the <a href="http://www.lokigames.com/development/smpeg.php3">SMPEG
   homepage</a>.</li>
  <li>The SDL_mixer library, <code>SDL_mixer-1.0.5-1.i386.rpm</code> (or later),
   from <a href="http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_mixer/">the SDL_mixer
   homepage</a>.</li>
  <li>The SDL_net library. There is no official package of this so I made
   my own, <code>SDL_net-1.1.1.i386.rpm</code>, available from
   <a href="ftp://prboom.sourceforge.net/pub/prboom/SDL_net-1.1.1-1.i386.rpm">here</a>.</li>
  <li>PrBoom itself, <code>prboom-2.1.0-0.i386.rpm</code>, from the
   <a href="#download">PrBoom download page</a>.</li>
 </ul>
 <p>In total that's about 850k to download</p>
 <p>Exception: Mandrake ships with all this stuff on the CDs. smpeg (and
  <a href="#timidity">timidity</a>)
  on the Mandrake CDs are fine, <em>but</em> the versions of the
  SDL libraries on the Mandrake CDs are too old and buggy to use with
  PrBoom. Don't try it - I have, they're no good. Get new ones from the
  URLs above.</p>
 <p>To install these, you use <code>rpm</code>. E.g. if you downloaded all
  of the above RPMs into one directory, <code>cd</code> to that directory
  and run <code>rpm -ivh <code>*.rpm</code></code>. You can then run PrBoom as
  <code>/usr/games/prboom</code>.
 </p>
 <h3>Compiling from source</h3>
  <p>If you want to compile from source, then you need all of the above
   packages, and also <code>SDL-devel-1.1.4-1.i386.rpm</code> (from
   <a href="http://www.libsdl.org/download-1.1.html">the SDL 1.1
   download page</a>) and <code>SDL_mixer-devel-1.0.5-1.i386.rpm</code> (again from
   the <a href="http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_mixer/">SDL_mixer
   homepage</a>).</p>
<h2><a name="debian">Debian</a></h2>
 <p>
  Debian unstable contains packages of SDL and SDL_mixer. First, install
   the packages <code>libsdl1.1, libsdl1.1-dev, libsdl-mixer1.0,
   libsdl-mixer-dev, smpeg</code>.
   You also need the SDL_net library, which is not
   yet packaged for Debian; get the source from
   <a href="http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_net/">the SDL_net homepage</a>.
   Get the prboom source code <code>prboom-2.1.0.tar.gz</code> from our
   <a href="#download">download page</a>, extract, and then follow the
   included <code>INSTALL</code> instructions.</dd>
 </p>
<h2><a name="freebsd">FreeBSD</a></h2>
 <p>
  I've tested on FreeBSD 4.1-STABLE. The ports tree contains packages
   of most of the stuff you need. Make the following ports:
 </p></ul>
  <li>devel/sdl-devel</li>
  <li>audio/sdl_mixer (requires audio/smpeg)</li>
 </ul><p>
   You also need the SDL_net library, which you can get from
   <a href="http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_net/">it's homepage</a>.
   Note that because the sdl-devel port installs in a strange directory,
   you'll need to
   <code>ln -s ../SDL/SDL_net.h /usr/local/include/SDL11/SDL_net.h</code>
   or something similar.
 </p><p>
  Finally, get <code>prboom-2.1.0.tar.gz</code> the PrBoom source, extract,
  and follow the included <code>INSTALL</code> instructions.
 </p>
<h2><a name="unix">Generic UNIX</a></h2>
 <p>
  You need to get and install the following libraries:
 </p><ul>
  <li>SDL 1.1.x, from <a href="http://www.libsdl.org/download-1.1.html">the
   SDL 1.1 download page</a>.</li>
  <li>SDL_mixer, from <a href="http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_mixer/">its
   home page</a>. This also requires the following:
   <ul>
    <li>SMPEG, from <a href="http://www.lokigames.com/development/smpeg.php3">the SMPEG homepage</a>.</li>
   </ul>
   <p>I don't know about these, look 'em up yourself :-).</p>
  </li>
  <li>SDL_net, from <a href="http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_net/">its home
   page</a>.</li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  Then get <code>prboom-2.1.0.tar.gz</code> the PrBoom source, extract,
  and follow the included <code>INSTALL</code> instructions.
 </p>
<h2><a name="download">Download page</h2>
 <p>Is <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=3396">here</a>. It's possible that the version numbers on this page may not be up to date. You can figure it out :-).</p>
<h2><a name="timidity">Music</a></h2>
 <p>
  The SDL_mixer library used by PrBoom supports software MIDI music synthesis.
  If you want to hear the Doom music, you need a set of Timidity
  instrument patches.
  Debian includes a package <code>timidity-patches</code> which provides
  these. People with RPM based systems can
  <a href="http://rpmfind.net/linux/RPM/timidity-instruments.html">look
  for a package</a>. Everyone else, do a web search for timidity patch sets,
  there are plenty around.
 </p>
 <note>These patch sets are a large download (>5megs).</note>
 <p>
  SDL_mixer does not currently support hardware MIDI synthesis. We plan to nag
  the SDL developers about this. If you want it, you nag them too :-).
