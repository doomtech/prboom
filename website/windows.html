<h1>Installation on Windows Systems</h1>
<p>This page guides you through the installation of PrBoom.</p>
<p>PrBoom should work with Windows 95, Windows NT4.0 and Windows 2000 or above.</p>
<p>PrBoom for Windows comes in two versions. The one version has software rendering and is called <code>prboom.exe</code>, the other one has OpenGl rendering and is called <code>glboom.exe</code>.</p>
<p><a href="#download">Download</a> the version you want to use and unzip it to the directory you want it. For example <code>c:\prboom</code>. To unzip it use a program like <a href="http://www.winzip.com">WinZip</a> or <a href="http://www.rarsoft.com/">WinRAR</a>.
<p>If you want music support, see the <a href="#timidity">music section</a>.</p>
<h2><a name="download">Download page</h2>
 <p>Is <a href="http://www.sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=3396">here</a>. It's possible that the version numbers on this page may not be up to date. You can figure it out :-).</p>
 <p>PrBoom uses the SDL library (>=1.1.6), the SDL_mixer (>=1.0.6) library and the SDL_net (>=1.1.1) library. The dlls for them are included in the packages. If you want to look for newer versions go to there homepages. SDL is at <a href="http://www.libsdl.org">http://www.libsdl.org</a>. SDL_mixer is at <a href="http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_mixer/">http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_mixer/</a>. SDL_net is at <a href="http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_net/">http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_net/</a>.
<h2><a name="timidity">Music</a></h2>
 <p>
  The SDL_mixer library used by PrBoom supports software MIDI music synthesis.
  If you want to hear the Doom music, you need a set of Timidity
  instrument patches. Do a web search for timidity patch sets,
  there are plenty around.
 </p>
 <note>These patch sets are a large download (>5megs).</note>
 <p>
  SDL_mixer does not currently support hardware MIDI synthesis. We plan to nag
  the SDL developers about this. If you want it, you nag them too :-).
