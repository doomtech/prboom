this is an attempt to dynamically generate menu entries.

the entries in doom2 IWAD are

	New game
		NEW GAME
	Choose Skill Level
		I'm too young to die.
		Hey, not too rough.
		Hurt me plenty.
		Ultra-Violence.
		Nightmare! (diff. font)
	Load game
	Save game
	Options
		End Game
		Screen Size
		Mouse sensitivity
		Sound Volume
		Sfx Volume
		Music Volume
	Quit Game

(what about differences in IWAD versions and doom 1 etc.?)

the entries we currently have in prboom.wad are:

	frags about automap chat doom demos enemies
	features general horizontal heads key messages mouse
	multiplayer setup sound status vertical video
	load weapons prboom



The idea is we might be able to dynamically compose
the required menu graphics by taking chunks of the patches for
the existing menu entries and possibly composing them together,
abusing the texture code.

General
	capital G: NEW GAME
	e,n,r,l: Hurt me plenty.
	a: New game

Setup
	S: Sound Volume
	e,t,u,p: Hurt me plenty.
Doom Compability
	D: not present! lower case in "I'm too young to die"
		or, Deimos Anomaly? or, Dead simple?

			how big are the level texts/
	o,m,i,t,y: I'm too young to die
	C:
	b:
	a,l: ultra violence
