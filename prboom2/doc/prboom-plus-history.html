<h1>Change Log</h1>

<br><span class="ver">2.4.8.5</span>
<span class="date">&nbsp;@&nbsp;2008-Oct-02</span>
<table>
<tr><td class="aaa">[*]</td><td>Set processor affinity mask under non-Windows platforms using the POSIX API (from chocolate-doom). This is a workaround for a bug in SDL_mixer that causes occasional crashes.
<tr><td class="aaa">[-]</td><td>Fixed crash when the nodes used for in-wad demo playback are not the same as those used for playing. (introduced in 2.4.8.3)
<tr><td class="aaa">[-]</td><td>Strange behaviour may result if a dehacked patch changed the music or sound lump names. (introduced in 2.4.8.2)
<tr><td class="aaa">[-]</td><td>Fixed crash if a response file (i.e. @myargs.rsm) is used.
</table>

<br><span class="ver">2.4.8.4</span>
<span class="date">&nbsp;@&nbsp;2008-Sep-07</span>
<table>
<tr><td class="aaa">[*]</td><td>New application icon.
<tr><td class="aaa">[*]</td><td>ENDOOM/ENDBOOM support using text mode emulation by fraggle.

<tr><td class="aaa">[*]</td><td>New algorithm for detection of fake flats and ceilings. It is much more correct and little bit quicker. Now glboom+ can detect complex systems from sectors without bottom/top textures and draw correct height, lighting and pic. Eternal.wad, map05, sectors 462 and 489 are simple examples; see sourceforge bug #2083354 for more examples.
<tr><td class="aaa">[-]</td><td>Memory overrun in F_BunnyScroll in software mode. Introduced in 2.4.8.3.
<tr><td class="aaa">[-]</td><td>Wrong flats drawing in software mode. Introduced in 2.4.8.3.
</table>

<br><span class="ver">2.4.8.3</span>
<span class="date">&nbsp;@&nbsp;2008-Aug-23</span>
<table>
<tr><td class="aaa">[!]</td><td>Updated to the latest prboom 2.4.8. (SVN build, revision 2741)
<tr><td class="aaa">[+]</td><td>Support for DDS format of hires textures.

<tr><td class="aaa">[+]</td><td>Ability to change the level of anisotropic filtering from the in-game menu.
<tr><td class="aaa">[+]</td><td>Real "black and white" effect for invul. It needs OpenGL 1.3.
<tr><td class="aaa">[+]</td><td>Motion blur effect for strafe50. (gl_motionbloor 1 in config)
<tr><td class="aaa">[+]</td><td>Ability to use only the allowed CPUs. It is necessary for buggy SDL_mixer (<=1.2.8 at least) on multi-processors at least win32 systems. process_affinity_mask in config. A process affinity mask is a bit vector in which each bit represents the processor on which the threads of the process are allowed to run.
<tr><td class="aaa">[+]</td><td>gl_compatibility variable in cfg. Try setting it to 1 if you have any problems in OpenGL. All OpenGL extentions will be disabled in this case.
<tr><td class="aaa">[+]</td><td>An alternative way of sky drawing was added (gl_drawskys 2 in cfg). This method make sense only for old hardware which has no support for GL_TEXTURE_GEN_*. Voodoo, for example. There are some bugs with alternative skies (see map12), but it is better than being without a sky at all. If you have red color instead of sky, then this ability is for you.
<tr><td class="aaa">[+]</td><td>Ability to play wads with wrong SEGS lump if workaround is possible. Demo recording is not allowed on such levels. See e1m9 @ <a href="http://www.doomworld.com/idgames/index.php?id=12647">NIVELES.WAD</a> as example.

<tr><td class="aaa">[+]</td><td>Additional sector light mode was added. (Options\General\Sector Light Mode - GZDOOM) This method has 32 levels of brightness instead of 5. There is new command-line switch "-resetgamma" for restoring original gamma after crashes.
<tr><td class="aaa">[+]</td><td>Ability to play MP3 and OGG from wad.
<tr><td class="aaa">[+]</td><td>New 'mixed' lighting mode for opengl. It uses gamma ramps like in gzdoom mode and it has 32 levels of gamma, but instead of changing device gamma it applies new gamma to textures. So it needs to reload all textures after change of gamma.
<tr><td class="aaa">[+]</td><td>Added demo compatibility with chex.exe  ("-exe chex" command-line switch)
<pre class="code">glboom-plus.exe -iwad doom.wad -exe chex -file chex.wad -deh chex.deh -playdemo chex1.lmp
You must use chex.deh by fraggle
http://chexmania.tripod.com/downloads.htm
http://www.doomworld.com/idgames/?id=15420</pre>
<tr><td class="aaa">[*]</td><td>Win32 build is compiled with Microsoft Visual Studio 2008.
<tr><td class="aaa">[*]</td><td>OpenGL: Original doom added/removed one light level for walls exactly vertical/horizontal on a map, but old code used 8 instead of 16.
<tr><td class="aaa">[*]</td><td>More precise rotation of sprites if render_paperitems is set to zero.
<tr><td class="aaa">[*]</td><td>Unsupported GL nodes will be ignored instead of closing PrBoom-Plus with an error message.

<tr><td class="aaa">[*]</td><td>Ability to play wads with wrong flat names. Unknown flats will be replaced with "NO TEXTURE" preset from prboom-plus.wad.
<tr><td class="aaa">[*]</td><td>Make missing sounds non-fatal. Makes sense for doom.wad v1.2 to skip some absent sounds.
<tr><td class="aaa">[*]</td><td>Intercepts overrun code should work properly on big endian machines as well as little endian machines.
<tr><td class="aaa">[*]</td><td>The title screen music in <a href="http://www.doomworld.com/idgames/index.php?id=8808">deca.wad</a> is a corrupted mus that nonetheless somehow manages to play properly in Vanilla Doom. Now you can hear such music in PrBoom-Plus too, because new mus2mid code is capable of converting the corrupted mus when MUS header checking is disabled.
<tr><td class="aaa">[*]</td><td>MBF Sky property-transfer linedef types will be applied for boom compatibility again. It was a bad idea to disable it.
<tr><td class="aaa">[*]</td><td>Advanced syntax for -geom command-line switch. Syntax: -geom WidthxHeight[w|f], w - windowed, f - fullscreen. Examples: -geom 320x200f, -geom 640x480w, -geom 1024x768
<tr><td class="aaa">[*]</td><td>Speedup in software renderer.

<tr><td class="aaa">[*]</td><td>"Rendering Quality" now is available in software mode too. "Quality" mode can kill some "slime trails", but it works slower. In the previous version of PrBoom-Plus the "Quality" mode was forced.
<tr><td class="aaa">[*]</td><td>Lower memory usage if colormaps are used in OpenGL.
<tr><td class="aaa">[*]</td><td>Speedup of level reloading in OpenGL mode (savegame, loadgame, loadgame...). Loadgame from the current (same) level now is much faster (100x). It is very noticeable on big levels like MAP05 @ <a href="http://www.doomworld.com/idgames/index.php?id=15125">epic.wad</a>.
<tr><td class="aaa">[*]</td><td>There is no longer a need to restart glboom-plus after a change of texture filter (mipmap, aniso)
<tr><td class="aaa">[*]</td><td>More accurate patch drawing. Predefined arrays are used instead of dynamic calculation of the top and bottom screen coordinates of a column. New algo makes sense for small elements of the HUD (digits) in resolutions which are not multiple of 320x200.
<tr><td class="aaa">[*]</td><td>"-videodriver" switch choice is saved in cfg.
<tr><td class="aaa">[*]</td><td>For pre-Ultimate Doom complevels, the fourth episode is not allowed.
<tr><td class="aaa">[-]</td><td>Fixed crash after "reset to defaults" from in-game menu. It's an old bug and all the previous versions of prboom worked without crash only by luck.

<tr><td class="aaa">[-]</td><td>Fixed bug if translucency percentage is less than 50, in which case all translucent textures and sprites disappeared completely.
<tr><td class="aaa">[-]</td><td>Disabling transparency in OpenGL for original sprites which are not changed by dehacked, because it does not work correctly in cases when transparent sprites are behind transparent walls. Global sorting of transparent sprites and walls is needed.
<tr><td class="aaa">[-]</td><td>Mouse look did not work on automap in overlay mode.
<tr><td class="aaa">[-]</td><td>Fix bug with bringing up the launcher with SHIFT key.
<tr><td class="aaa">[-]</td><td>Rooms you haven't visited and are behind closed doors (with no windows) show up on the automap when you walk up to the doors without opening them. This bug was introduced in the 2.4.8.2 release with new clipper code.
<tr><td class="aaa">[-]</td><td>Fixed problems with association of PrBoom-Plus with DOOM demos if you are not Administrator. Makes sense for Vista.
<tr><td class="aaa">[-]</td><td>Fix bug with sky at the bottom part of an imaginary skybox around a level if mouse look is used. Map30 @  "Deus Vult II: First Edition" is a good example.
<tr><td class="aaa">[-]</td><td>OpenGL: More correct (similar to software) drawing of skies with height more than 128 if mouse look is not used.
<tr><td class="aaa">[-]</td><td>Fix random color of pixels instead of black during first wiping on fullscreen in software mode.

<tr><td class="aaa">[-]</td><td>Bug with sprites on big-endian systems like Apple's Macintosh line prior to the Intel switch.
<tr><td class="aaa">[-]</td><td>Fixed error in OpenGL when upper texture on the linedef with "Transfer Sky Texture" action is not set ('-'). 'ASHWALL1' with zero index must be forced in this case, which I did for normal not transferred skies some time ago.
<tr><td class="aaa">[-]</td><td>Fix vanilla imprecise calculation (vibrations) of the texture coordinates for flats in software renderer. Visplanes with the same texture now match up far better than before. You can see this bug on cchest2.wad\map02 in the room with moving illumination around the room with sector 265. The new algo is ~1% slower than the original and will be used only if render_precise is 1.
<tr><td class="aaa">[-]</td><td>Fixed wrong processing of the "Blue Armor Class" and "Green Armor Class" strings from a DEH.
<tr><td class="aaa">[-]</td><td>"Flashing HOM indicator" option did nothing. Fixed.
<tr><td class="aaa">[-]</td><td>Fixed crash between e1m4 and e1m5 on <a href="http://chexmania.tripod.com/downloads.htm">chex.wad</a>.
<tr><td class="aaa">[-]</td><td>Key for entering setup menu had no entry in config.
<tr><td class="aaa">[-]</td><td>The supersecret "COOL!" area of Kama Sutra map15 had a rather ugly texturing bug (GL only).

<tr><td class="aaa">[-]</td><td>There is no longer a line of graphics under certain weapons in GL.

<tr><td></td><td><b>From PrBoom</b>
<tr><td class="aaa">-</td><td>Added high color rendering
<tr><td class="aaa">-</td><td>Ignore switches that reference unknown textures instead of exiting
<tr><td class="aaa">-</td><td>When using spy mode in a multiplayer demo in demo_compatibility mode, play the expected player's pickup sounds (the currently displayed player, not the player at the console when the demo was recorded)
<tr><td class="aaa">-</td><td>Fix crash when loading maps with missing player starts.
<tr><td class="aaa">-</td><td>Fix crash when reloading network savegames.
<tr><td class="aaa">-</td><td>Fix bug in transparency rendering caused by doing it in two places.
<tr><td class="aaa">-</td><td>Fix the colour of player 4 (red) in multiplayer.

<tr><td class="aaa">-</td><td>Fix position of netgame player arrows on automap in rotate mode.
<tr><td class="aaa">-</td><td>Always draw player arrows on the automap in deathmatch demo playback. Previously they'd only be drawn if you played the demo from the command line.
<tr><td class="aaa">-</td><td>Ignore chat key presses in demo playback and in -solo-net

<span class="date">&nbsp;@&nbsp;2007-10-16</span>
<table>
<tr><td class="aaa">[!]</td><td>Updated to the latest prboom 2.4.8. (SVN build, revision 2423).
<tr><td class="aaa">[+]</td><td>New mouse code without SDL lags. Win32 mouse handling was removed.
<tr><td class="aaa">[+]</td><td>Boom colormaps are supported in OpenGL mode.
<tr><td class="aaa">[+]</td><td>New mus -> mid conversion code thanks to Ben Ryves benryves@benryves.com This removes bugs and plays back a lot of music closer to Vanilla Doom - eg. tnt.wad map02.
<tr><td class="aaa">[+]</td><td>Smooth movement: interpolation of weapon bobbing.
<tr><td class="aaa">[+]</td><td>New command-line switch "-emulate prboom_ver" for emulation of old buggy behaviour of previous prboom versions during playback of doom\doom2\boom\mbf\lxdoom demos in cases where a prboom bug affects the demo compatibility and leads to desyncs in the original EXEs. Now you can specify only "-emulate 2.2.6" instead of set of -force_remove_slime_trails, -force_boom_brainawake, etc. For example, boom-incompatible demo by Anima Zero cc2lmps.zip\c215-uv.lmp recorded with prboom 2.2.4 in boom compatibility mode can be correctly viewed in newer versions with -emulate 2.2.4 or with -force_prboom_friction.
<tr><td class="aaa">[+]</td><td>PC Speaker emulation from chocolate-doom.
<tr><td class="aaa">[+]</td><td>New command-line switch "-force_lxdoom_demo_compatibility" for emulation of all bugs in demo compatibility mode in lxdoom. There are no more desynchs on "Doom-incompatible" demos from DHT6 exams.
<tr><td class="aaa">[+]</td><td>Ability to force -nomonsters and -respawn for playback of 1.2 demos. Demos recorded with Doom.exe 1.2 did not contain any information about whether these parameters had been used. In order to play them back, you should add them to the command-line for playback. There is no more desynch on <a href="http://www.doomworld.com/idgames/index.php?id=13976">mesh.lmp @ mesh.wad</a> (prboom -iwad doom.wad -file mesh.wad -playdemo mesh.lmp -nomonsters)
<tr><td class="aaa">[+]</td><td>There is a new command-line switch "-shorttics". This makes it possible to practice routes and tricks (e.g. glides, where this makes a significant difference) with the same mouse behaviour as when recording, but without having to be recording every time.
<tr><td class="aaa">[+]</td><td>Wipe screen effect in OpenGL.
<tr><td class="aaa">[+]</td><td>Support for Hi-Res textures and patches in OpenGL.
<tr><td class="aaa">[+]</td><td>Import the clipper code from gzdoom. Thanks to GrafZahl. PrBoom uses a clipper with screen pixel precision. It isn't precise enough for GL. For GL we need a clipper with angular precision to avoid some kind of glitches.
<tr><td class="aaa">[*]</td><td>Events queue will not be cleared at the start. (like vanilla does)
<tr><td class="aaa">[*]</td><td>"No Quit Sound" is renamed to "Fast Exit". EndDoom screen will be skipped if this option is turned on.
<tr><td class="aaa">[*]</td><td>Effect of invulnerability uses a colormap in OpenGL mode instead of hard-coding. See <a href="http://www.doomworld.com/idgames/index.php?id=11402">nuts.wad</a> as example.
<tr><td class="aaa">[*]</td><td>"Sky is unaffected by invulnerability" compatibility setting (comp_skymap) works in OpenGL mode now.
<tr><td class="aaa">[*]</td><td>"Paper Items" setting has no effect for hanging things.
<tr><td class="aaa">[*]</td><td>The player's weapon is displayed much darker than in 'vanilla' and other ports. In this version the mistake is corrected only for software rendering.
<tr><td class="aaa">[*]</td><td>Improved support for Doom v1.2: Projectiles, such as monster and player plasma and rockets, were able to activate down-wait-up type lifts in versions of Doom up to v1.2.
<tr><td class="aaa">[*]</td><td>Monsters on automap are drawn on top of other things to avoid situations when red triangles (live and countable monsters) are hidden by the green triangles for non-countable things.
<tr><td class="aaa">[*]</td><td>Show a warning if savegame is from the previous version of prboom-plus.
<tr><td class="aaa">[*]</td><td>"-recordfromto" works for all levels of compatibility.
<tr><td class="aaa">[*]</td><td>Improved precision. There are no more HOM's on maps with big open areas: nuts.wad at some positions, <a href="http://www.doomworld.com/idgames/index.php?id=14476">thespir2.wad</a> at the start, <a href="http://www.doomworld.com/idgames/index.php?id=14975">Generator of Evil.wad</a> in last room, MAP05 @ <a href="http://www.doomworld.com/idgames/index.php?id=15125">epic.wad</a>. everywhere, etc.
<tr><td class="aaa">[*]</td><td>Huge speedup in OpenGL on levels with sectors which have many lines. I've got 87 fps (timedemo) on MAP05 @ <a href="http://www.doomworld.com/idgames/index.php?id=15125">epic.wad</a> in this version instead of 64 in 2.4.8.1.
<tr><td class="aaa">[*]</td><td>Compatibility with common mapping errors "linedefs w/o tags apply locally" works with Walk and Gunfire triggers (not only with switches) as in (G)ZDoom.
<tr><td class="aaa">[-]</td><td>Non traditional menu was removed to avoid problems with, e.g., <a href="http://www.doomworld.com/idgames/index.php?id=11790">Alien Vendetta</a>.
<tr><td class="aaa">[-]</td><td>Launcher: wrong strings in history combobox.
<tr><td class="aaa">[-]</td><td>Fixed Boom incompatibilities. There are no more desyncs on Donce's demos on <a href="http://www.doomworld.com/idgames/index.php?id=13635">horror.wad</a>
<tr><td class="aaa">[-]</td><td>Fixed Boom incompatibilities. Original friction and bobbing code was restored. There are no more desyncs on <a href="http://competn.doom2.net/pub/sda/0-a/art_950.zip">cybart.lmp</a> @ <a href="http://www.doomworld.com/idgames/index.php?id=9832">Artica.wad</a> and <a href="http://competn.doom2.net/pub/sda/d-h/dis_0942.zip">dismlmp.lmp</a> @ <a href="http://www.doomworld.com/idgames/index.php?id=9787">dismem.wad</a>. "-force_prboom_friction" for emulation of old buggy behaviour.
<tr><td class="aaa">[-]</td><td>%DOOMWADDIR% had no effect for PWADs and DEHs.
<tr><td class="aaa">[-]</td><td>A strip of rendered graphics could sometimes be seen under the status bar, along the bottom during intermission screens and in the rollcall screen.
<tr><td class="aaa">[-]</td><td>With OpenGL rendering, many of the translucent windows in MAP29 @ <a href="http://www.doomworld.com/idgames/index.php?id=13024">cchest2.wad</a> are visible from one side only.
<tr><td class="aaa">[-]</td><td>Boom bug: Fixed incompatibility with original EXE's (complevels 0..6) on levels with "Monster Spawner". "-force_boom_brainawake" for emulation of old buggy behaviour. There is no more desynch on 300340HR.lmp @ <a href="http://www.doomworld.com/idgames/index.php?id=10513">RlmChaos.wad</a>.
<tr><td class="aaa">[-]</td><td>When radsuit ends, palette changes w/o warning.
<tr><td class="aaa">[-]</td><td>When playing back with -recordfromto, and before resuming recording, pausing causes playback to desync.
<tr><td class="aaa">[-]</td><td>OpenGL: Fix an issue with lines (boxes) which appear around the elements that change on the intermission screens in Doom1. Thanks to Graf Zahl.
<tr><td class="aaa">[-]</td><td>When a file with the .BEX extension is used in an autoloading pattern, the program fails to load it.
<tr><td class="aaa">[-]</td><td>Boom bug: Correction for DEHs which swap the values of two strings. For example: Text 6 6 - RUNNINSTALKS; Text 6 6 - STALKSRUNNIN. There are no more bugs on <a href="http://www.doomworld.com/idgames/index.php?id=6480">AllHell.wad</a>.
<tr><td class="aaa">[-]</td><td>Kills percentage, if extremely high, was reported wrongly and could in theory lead to desyncs.
<tr><td class="aaa">[-]</td><td>PrBoom bug: Par times were not displayed. The program was viewing prboom(-plus).wad as a pwad, and therefore the piece of code that suppressed par times was always being triggered.
<tr><td class="aaa">[-]</td><td>Sometimes the pistol sounds that play while the tallies are being totaled on the end screen will play for too long after the completion time has finished tallying.
<tr><td class="aaa">[-]</td><td>There is no more crash on <a href="http://competn.doom2.net/pub/compet-n/doom/coop/movies/e1cmnet3.zip">e1cmnet3.lmp</a> between e1m2 and e1m3.
<tr><td class="aaa">[-]</td><td>Smart totals: Monsters spawned by an Monster Spawner should not be countable for total killed.
<tr><td class="aaa">[-]</td><td>Avoid crashes at end of demos if DEMOMARKER (0x80) does not exist at the end.
<tr><td class="aaa">[-]</td><td>ScreenShot feature did not work with "-videodriver directx" on fullscreen software.
<tr><td class="aaa">[-]</td><td>There are no more visual glitches with sky on MAP14 @ <a href="http://www.doomworld.com/idgames/index.php?id=5191">Icarus</a> and MAP20 @ <a href="http://www.doomworld.com/idgames/index.php?id=7947">Hell Revealed</a>. GZDoom still has this bug.
<tr><td class="aaa">[-]</td><td>Fix of no warning (flashes between shadowed and solid) in OpenGL when invisibility is about to go.
<tr><td class="aaa">[-]</td><td>Fixed wrong finding of next highest floor (linedef action 18, 20, 131) for demo compatibility. There are no more desynchs on <a href="http://www.doomworld.com/idgames/index.php?id=15025">napalm.wad</a>.
<tr><td class="aaa">[-]</td><td>The priority system is broken in the ouch face code in a way that makes the face not work with monster damage.
<tr><td class="aaa">[-]</td><td>Move mouse sensitivity menu upwards a little to avoid overlap with status bar with accompanying visual glitches on software renderer.
<tr><td class="aaa">[-]</td><td>The bug in the algorithm for splitting of a sector into closed contours was fixed. There is no more HOM at the starting area on MAP16 @ Eternal.wad in OpenGL. I hope nothing was broken.
<tr><td class="aaa">[-]</td><td>Correction of an overflow in calculation of a sound origin on large levels. New code is applied only for non-compatible modes and with comp_sound equal to zero. There is no more bug with an absent sound after pressing the distant western switch on Hell Spirit (not released) by Alexander "Eternal" S.
<tr><td class="aaa">[-]</td><td>Premature program exit during map26 in 4-player coop demo 29uv4p_*.lmp @ doom2.wad. This bug was introduced in r1458 by cph for 2.4.3 release.
<tr><td class="aaa">[-]</td><td>Wrong calculation of weapon width in OpenGL in some cases, especially during movement. Shotgun in <a href="http://www.doomworld.com/idgames/index.php?id=11009">DSV3_War</a> looks correct now.
<tr><td class="aaa">[-]</td><td>OpenGL: Blink during demoskip on fullscreen.
<tr><td class="aaa">[-]</td><td>OpenGL: Bug with duplicated lines, e.g. MM.WAD Map22 lines 1298 and 2397. There is no more HOM on Memento Mori MAP22 sector 299.
<tr><td class="aaa">[-]</td><td>Fixed slowdown during screen melt at 1024x768 on some systems.
<tr><td class="aaa">[-]</td><td>Transferred sky texture on scrolled wall were not scrolled with mouselook or changed FOV.
<tr><td class="aaa">[-]</td><td>Sky property-transfer linedef types (271, 272) should not be applied for BOOM complevels.

<table>
<tr><td class="aaa">[!]</td><td>Updated to the latest prboom 2.4.8 (SVN build, revision 2355).
<tr><td class="aaa">[+]</td><td>Compatibility with common mapping errors: "Walk underneath solid hanging bodies". Thanks to RjY.
<tr><td class="aaa">[+]</td><td>Launcher: Autoselecting of wads according to the lmp file-name (using regular expressions)
<tr><td class="aaa">[+]</td><td>Two new compatibility options are added:
  <ul>
    <li>comp_ouchface - "Use Doom's buggy 'Ouch' face code"
    <li>comp_oofsound - "Dead players make 'oof' sound when landing"
  </ul>
<tr><td class="aaa">[+]</td><td>New "-auto" command-line switch for autoloading of wads according to the lmp file-name.
<tr><td class="aaa">[+]</td><td>There are three modes of sprite clipping in opengl:
  <ul>
    <li>Constant - gl_sprite_offset used;
    <li>Always - if the sprite is below the floor, and it's not a hanger/floater/missile;
    <li>Smart - if the sprite is below the floor, and it's not a hanger/floater/missile, and it's not a fully dead corpse;
  </ul>
<tr><td class="aaa">[+]</td><td>Demo progress bar works during skipping.
<tr><td class="aaa">[+]</td><td>Improved handling of unrecognized demo formats. Legacy and Boom v2.00 demos do not crash PrBoom-Plus now.

<tr><td class="aaa">[+]</td><td>New "all-in-one" version that includes the resource wad and SDL files inside the exe.
<tr><td class="aaa">[*]</td><td>Compatibility with common mapping errors "Pad a too short reject with zeros" was removed. Added new command line switch "-reject_pad_with_ff". PrBoom 2.2.5 and 2.2.6 padded a short REJECT with 0xff (ones) instead of zeros. This command-line switch may be needed for demos recorded with these versions of PrBoom on maps with a too short REJECT. For example: <a href="http://competn.doom2.net/pub/sda/d-h/equxlmps.zip">equ7-108.lmp</a>@<a href="http://www.doomworld.com/idgames/index.php?id=14219">lwfirst.wad</a>.

    <li>"Ultimate Doom v1.9" -> "Ultimate Doom/Doom95"
    <li>"Final Doom/Doom95" -> "Final Doom"
  </ul>
<tr><td class="aaa">[*]</td><td>Removing startup delay during recording. You can record demos from the first tic now.
<tr><td class="aaa">[*]</td><td>Correction in "smart items clipping": a not fully dead corpse should be moved up, exploding barrels for example; a missile should not be moved.
<tr><td class="aaa">[*]</td><td>Improved support for Doom v1.2:
  <ul>
    <li>Max Health Bonus = 199;
    <li>Max Armor = unlimited;
    <li>Max Soulsphere = 199;
    <li>Megasphere Health = 199 (there was no megasphere back then, but this seems consistent);
