       PPrrBBoooomm  is  a version of the 3D shoot'em'up Doom, originally by id
       software.  It includes, amongst other things, the ability to  play
       with  several  players connected by a tcp/ip network. prboom-game-
       server is the `server', that  is  the  program  that  passes  data
       between the different players in the game.

       To  start  a  network game (often abbreviated to `netgame'), first
       the server is started. prboom-game-server accepts various  parame-
       ters to control the type of game (the skill level, number of play-
       ers, level to play, optional WAD file(s) to load, etc).

       Then each player that wishes to participate runs prboom -net _h_o_s_t_-
       _n_a_m_e,  where  _h_o_s_t_n_a_m_e  is  the  name  of the machine on which the
       server is running. Each copy of prboom retrieves information about
       the game from the server, and when the specified number of players
       have joined, the game begins.


OOppttiioonnss
       -N _p_l_a_y_e_r_s
              Specifies the number of players in the  game  (default  2).
              The  server  will wait for this many players to join before
              starting the game.

       -e _e_p_i_s
              The episode to play (default 1).  Unless  you  are  playing
              Doom  1 or Ultimate Doom, and wish to play one of the later
              episodes, you do not need to change this.

       -l _l_e_v_e_l
              The level to play (default 1).

       -s _s_k_i_l_l
              Specify the skill level to play (1-5).

       -d     Set game mode to (old) deathmatch (default is cooperative).
              See  the  original Doom docs for information about the dif-
              ferent network game modes.

       -a     Set game mode to `altdeath'  (v2  deathmatch)  (default  is
              cooperative).  See  the  original Doom docs for information
              about the different network game modes.

       -f     Select fast mode (monsters move faster).




                              local                             1





PRBOOM-GAME-SERVER(6)                       PRBOOM-GAME-SERVER(6)


       -n     Selects nomonsters mode, i.e. there are no monsters in  the
              game.

       -r     Respawn  mode.  If  you  don't know what this is, you don't
              want to ;-).

       -w _w_a_d_n_a_m_e[,_d_l___u_r_l]
              Specifies a WAD file to play. This is added to the internal
              list  that  the  server  keeps. When a client connects, the
              server sends the list of WADs; PrBoom will then add this to
              the  list  of  WADs specified on its command line.  Option-
              ally, an url to the file can be given too; if  when  PrBoom
              connects  it  cannot find the named WAD, it will attempt to
              retrieve the file from the given url, extracting it if nec-
              essary.  See  prboom(1) for information about the supported
              url types and compression formats.

       -t _t_i_c_d_u_p
              Reserved.

       -x _x_t_i_c_s
              This causes extra information to be sent with each  network
              packet;  this  will help on networks with high packet loss,
              but will use more bandwidth.

       -p _p_o_r_t
              Tells prboom-game-server what port  number  to  communicate
              via  (default 5030).  Note that if you change this from the
              default, then all the clients will  also  need  to  specify
              this  number  when  they  try  to connect (the default pro-
              grammed into prboom is also 5030).

       -v     Increases verbosity level; causes more  diagnostics  to  be
              printed, the more times -v is specified.

       PPrrBBoooomm is a version of the 3D shoot'em'up Doom, originally by iD software.
       It   is   based   on   Boom,   a   version  of  Doom  adapted  by  TeamTNT
       (http://www.teamtnt.com) for DOS.

        lxdoom is a port of Boom to Linux, which runs under  XFree86.  lsdoom  is
       the  same program but compiled to run under SVGALib. They support the same
       command line parameters (with a few exceptions as noted below).

OOppttiioonnss
       -complevel _l_v_l
              This sets the compatibility mode that PrBoom runs in. If  you  need
              to change this, see README.compat.


VViiddeeoo OOppttiioonnss
       -width _w
              Specifies  the  width  of  the PrBoom window, in pixels. Default is
              320, the width must be greater than 320..

       -height _h
              Specifies the height of the PrBoom window, in  pixels.  Default  is
              200, the height must be greater than 200.

WWAADD OOppttiioonnss
       -iwad _i_w_a_d_n_a_m_e
              Specifies  the  location  of  the  IWAD file, typically doom.wad or
              doom2.wad (or doom2f.wad). This tells lxdoom where  the  main  .wad
              file that came with the version of Doom that you own is.

       -file _w_a_d_1 _._._.
              Specifies  a  list  of  PWAD  files to load in addition to the IWAD
              file. PWAD files modify the existing Doom game, by adding levels or
              new  sounds  or graphics. PWAD files are widely available for down-
              load; try ftp.cdrom.com/pub/idgames for starters. .TP -deh _d_e_h___f_i_l_e
              Tells PrBoom to load the dehacked patch _d_e_h___f_i_l_e. .SH Game Options

       -loadgame {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7}
              Instructs PrBoom to load the specified saved game immediately.

       -warp { _m_a_p | _e_p_i_s _l_e_v_e_l }
              Tells  PrBoom  to begin a new game immediately. For Doom 1 or Ulti-
              mate Doom, you must specify the _e_p_i_sode and _l_e_v_e_l number  to  begin
              at  (_e_p_i_s  is  1 for Knee-Deep in the Dead, 2 for Shores of Hell, 3
              for Inferno, 4 for Ultimate Doom; _l_e_v_e_l is between 1  and  9).  For
              Doom  ][ or Final Doom, you must specify the _m_a_p to begin at, which
              is between 1 and 32 (30 for german Doom ][).  .TP  -skill  _n  Tells
              LxDoom  to  begin the game at skill level _n (1 for ITYTD, 2 for Not
              Too Rough, 3 for Hurt Me Plenty, 4 for Ultraviolent, 5  for  Night-
              mare).

       -respawn Tells LxDoom that
              monsters that die should respawn (come back to life) after a while.
              Not for the inexperienced. .TP -fast Tells LxDoom to make  all  the
              monsters move  react faster. Not for the inexperienced.

       -nomonsters
              Tells PrBoom to include no monsters in the game.

MMuullttiippllaayyeerr OOppttiioonnss
       -net _h_o_s_t_n_a_m_e[:_p_o_r_t]
              Specifies  that a TCP/IP network game is to be started. _h_o_s_t_n_a_m_e is
              the name of the machine on which the network game server is running
              (prboom-game-server).  For more information about this, see prboom-
              game-server(6) and the README that came with lxdoom.  _p_o_r_t  is  the
              port number on the remote machine to which to connect; if not spec-
              ified, the default of 5030 (which is the default  for  lxdoom-game-
              server(6))  is assumed.  The server will configure your LxDoom set-
              tings, so that all tha players have the same game settings  (skill,
              map etc).

       Also, the server may specify additional PWAD files to play with; if you do
       not have the required .WAD file, LxDoom will ask the server for a download
       path, and attempt to use wget(1) and if necessary unzip(1) to download and
       extract the required WAD.

       -port _p_o_r_t_n_u_m
              Specifies the local port to use to communicate with the server in a
              netgame.

       -deathmatch
              No  longer  used. Tells LxDoom to begin a deathmatch game, but this
              is overridden by the server's settings. Only works for single  play
              (!).

       -altdeath
              Similar  to  -deathmatch,  but implies a different set of rules for
              the deathmatch game. No longer used (specified by the server).

       -timer _m_i_n_s
              No longer used. Specifies that levels will end after  _m_i_n_s  minutes



                              local                             2





LXDOOM(6)                                               LXDOOM(6)


              of  play  if  the level is still being played, but is overridden by
              the server in a netgame. Not really useful for single play.

       -avg   Equivalent to -timer 20

DDeemmoo ((LLMMPP)) OOppttiioonnss
       -record _d_e_m_o_f_i_l_e
              Instructs LxDoom to  begin  recording  a  demo,  to  be  stored  in
              _d_e_m_o_f_i_l_e.lmp.  You  should  specify  ggaammee  ooppttiioonnss to specify which
              level and skill to record at.

       -playdemo _d_e_m_o_f_i_l_e
              Play the recorded demo _d_e_m_o_f_i_l_e.lmp

       -timedemo _d_e_m_o_f_i_l_e
              Play the recorded demo _d_e_m_o_f_i_l_e.lmp,  reporting  information  about
              the length of the demo (in gametics) afterwards.

       -fastdemo _d_e_m_o_f_i_l_e
              Play the recorded demo _d_e_m_o_f_i_l_e.lmp as fast as possible. Useful for
              benchmarking LxDoom, as compared to other versions of Doom.

II//OO OOppttiioonnss
       -nosound
              Disables all sound effects and in-game  music.  This  prevents  the
              sound server loading, which lets the game run a little faster.

       -nosfx Disables  sound  effects  during  the  game. This does not stop the
              sound  server  loading,  however,  so  for  best  performance   use
              -nosound.

       -nomusic
              Disables playing of music in the game.

       -nojoy Disables joystick support.

       -noaccel
              For  lxdoom, this prevents it using the MITShm server extension for
              passing the screen data  to  the  X  server.  This  option  may  be
              required  if  the  X  server  is  not local. For lsdoom, this tells
              lsdoom not to use the accelerated graphics functions  that  SVGALib
              provides even when they are supported for your video card (normally
              this is autodetected).

       -{1,2,3}
              Specifies the scale factor by which  to  enlarge  the  window.  The
              default,  -1,  displays  the  normal  320x200 pixel Doom screen (or
              whatever size is specified by the -width and -height parameters  or
              in  the  config file for lxdoom).  If this window is too small, try
              using -2 or -3 to enlarge the window.

CCoonnffiigguurraattiioonn
       -config _m_y_c_o_n_f
              Loads an alternative configuration file, named _m_y_c_o_n_f. The  default

LXDOOM(6)                                               LXDOOM(6)


              is  boom.cfg, taken from the same directory as LxDoom was run from.

       -save _s_a_v_e_d_i_r
              Causes lxdoom to save games in the directory specified  by  _s_a_v_e_d_i_r
              instead of ~/.lxdoom/.

       -devparm
              Development  mode. This used to be required for many things, but is
              almost redundant now. It's only significant effect  (to  my  knowl-
              edge) is to show a series of white dots in the lower left corner of
              the lxdoom window. The current frame rate is (I think) 35 / (number
              of dots).

       -debugfile _d_e_b_u_g___f_i_l_e
              Causes  some  debugging information, mainly network info I believe,
              to be written to the named file as lxdoom runs.

       -nodrawers
              Causes no rendering to be done. The only conceivable use of this is
              (a)  a  multiplayer  server (b) to test the speed of the other rou-
              tines in the program, when combined with -timedemo.

       -noblit
              Causes no copying to the screen from the  rendering  buffer  to  be

       boom.cfg - Configuration file for PrBoom v2.1.0 onwards

UUSSAAGGEE
       When a version of PrBoom is run, it  searches for this configuration  file
       to  modify its default settings.  Every time PrBoom exits, it rewrites the
       configuration file, updating any settings that have been changed using the
       in-game menus.

       PrBoom  expects  the config file to be  ~/.prboom/boom.cfg. Alternatively,
       it can be made to look elsewhere by using a command-line parameter:

       {{pprrbboooomm,,xxpprrbboooomm}} [ -config _m_y_c_o_n_f ]

FFOORRMMAATT
       boom.cfg consists of a number of variables and values. Each line is of the
       following format:

       [  {  {{#,;,[}  _c_o_m_m_e_n_t___t_e_x_t  ,  _v_a_r_i_a_b_l_e {_d_e_c_i_m_a_l___i_n_t_e_g_e_r, 0x_h_e_x___i_n_t_e_g_e_r,
       "_s_t_r_i_n_g___t_e_x_t"}}]

       Any line beginning with a non-alphabetic character is treated as a comment
       and  ignored; for future compatibility you should start comments with a #,
       ; or [.  Note however that when PrBoom rewrites boom.cfg it does not  pre-
       serve user added comments.

       Any  line beginning with an alphabetic character is treated as a variable-
       value pair.  The first word (sequence of non-whitespace characters) is the
       variable  name,  and everything after the following block of whitespace is
       taken to be the value assigned to the variable.

       Variables not recognised by PrBoom, or which are given an invalid value or
       a  value of an inappropriate type, are ignored. Warning messages are given
       where relevant.

       The variables recognised by PrBoom are described per-section in  the  fol-
       lowing  sections.  The sections are informal however; when PrBoom rewrites
       the config file it writes in section headings and puts variables into  the
       relevant sections, but when reading these are ignored.

       compatibility_level
              PrBoom is capable of behaving in a way compatible with earlier ver-
              sions of Doom and Boom/PrBoom. The value  given  here  selects  the
              version  to  be  compatible  with  when  doing new games/demos. See
              README.compat for details.

       realtic_clock_rate
              Selects the speed that PrBoom runs at, as a  percentage  of  normal
              game  speed.  Leave at 100 unless you want to experiment. Note that
              it is considered `cheating' to use this at any  setting  below  100
              (or above?).

       max_player_corpse
              Sets the maximum number of player corpses to leave lying around. If
              this limit would be exceeded, an old corpse is removed. Useful  for
              big/long  Deathmatch games, where the sheer number of corpses could
              slow the game down.

       flashing_hom
              Flag indicating whether a flashing red background is drawn to high-
              light HOM errors in levels (for level developers)

       demo_insurance
              Selects  a  method  of protecting demos against `going out of sync'
              (where the player seems to lose control and behave  madly,  but  in
              fact  the  players original instructions as stored in the demo have
              got out of sync with the game he  was  playing).  0=No  protection,
              1=Full  protection,  2=Only while recording demos. Safest when left
              set to 2.

       endoom_mode
              This parameter specifies options controlling  the  display  of  the
              credits  screen  when  Doom  exits.  Currently  it  is the sum of 3
              options: add 1 for colours, 2 for non-ASCII characters to  be  dis-
              played,  and  4  for  the  last  line to be skipped so the top line
              doesn't scroll off screen.

       level_precache
              If set, when loading a new level PrBoom precaches all the  graphics
              the level is likely to need in memory. This makes it much slower to
              load the level, but reduces disk  activity  and  slowdowns  reading
              data  during  play. Most systems are fast enough that precaching is
              not needed.

              started.  A blank string means unused.


       dehfile_1, dehfile_2
              The  names  of  2  patch  files  (.deh or .bex) to be automatically

              for each weapon alone.

       player_bobbing
              Enables  player  bobbing  (view randomly moving up/down slightly as
              the player runs).

       monsters_remember
              Makes monsters remember their previous enemy  after  killing  their
              current target.

       monster_infighting
              Whether  monsters will fight each other when they injure each other
              accidentally.

       monster_backing
              Whether monsters without close combat weapons will back  away  from
              close combat (unlike original Doom).

       monster_avoid_hazards
              Whether monsters avoid crushing ceilings.

       monkeys
              Whether monsters will climb steep stairs.

       monster_friction
              Whether  monsters  are  affected  by  changed  floor friction (they
              should be, but weren't in Boom)

       help_friends
              Whether monsters will help out  injured  monsters  by  aiding  them
              against their attacker.

       player_helpers
              The number of helper dogs to spawn.

       friend_distance
              Distance within which friends will generally stay.

       dog_jumping
              Whether dogs will jump.

       sts_always_red
              PrBoom  makes  the  colour  of  the text displays on the status bar
              reflect your current status (red=low,  yellow=average,  green=good,
              blue=super-charged).   This option, if set, disables this behavior,
              returning to the original Doom behavior of displaying  the  numbers
              in red always, which is slightly faster.

       sts_pct_always_gray
              See  above,  this makes just the percent signs always gray, instead
              of changing colour.

       sts_traditional_keys
              Doom and PrBoom have two types of keys; PrBoom will  normally  dis-
              play  both keys of a given colour if you have both. This option, if
              enabled, instead makes PrBoom only ever display  one  key  of  each
              colour, in the same way Doom did.

       traditional_menu
              Changes  PrBoom's  menu ordering to be the same as original Doom if
              enabled.

       show_messages
              When enabled, text messages are displayed in the top left corner of
              the  screen  describing  events  in the game. Can be toggled in the
              game, this is just to preserve the setting.

       autorun
              Makes the player always run, without having to hold down a run key.
              Can be toggled in the game, this just preserves the setting.


SSOOUUNNDD SSEETTTTIINNGGSS
       sound_card
              Selects  whether  sound effects are enabled (non-zero enables). For
              compatibility reasons with Boom, a range of values are accepted.

       music_card
              Selects whether in-game music is enabled  (non-zero  enables).  For
              compatibility reasons a range of values are accepted.

       pitched_sounds
              If  enabled by this variable, this enables `pitching' (making pitch
              adjustments to the playing sounds) for 16 bit sound cards.

       sfx_volume
              Sound effects volume. This is best adjusted in the game.

       music_volume
              Music volume. This is best adjusted in the game.

       mus_pause_opt
              Selects what PrBoom does to the  music  when  a  games  is  paused.
              0=stop  the  music,  1=pause  the  music (stop it playing, but when
              resumed resume it at the same place - not implemented),  2=continue
              playing.

       sounddev, snd_channels, soundsrv, musicsrv
              These variables are no longer used by PrBoom, but are kept for com-
              patibility reasons.

       screen_width, screen_height
              For versions of PrBoom which support high-res,  these  specify  the
              default  screen  or  window  size  for  PrBoom.  These settings are
              ignored and preserved by versions of PrBoom which do not  do  high-
              res (they assume 320x200).

       use_vsync
              For versions of PrBoom that have access to the hardware at this low
              a level, this tells PrBoom to wait to update  the  screen  until  a
              vertical  retrace  of the CRT screen. This means that the screen is
              updated while nothing is being drawn, giving a  smoother  animation
              and faster redraws. However it does lower the frame-rate.

       translucency
              Causes PrBoom to display certain objects as translucent.

       tran_filter_pct
              Selects how translucent objects are when they are translucent. Play
              with this and see for yourself.

       screenblocks
              Selects a  reduced  screen  size  inside  the  PrBoom  window  (the
              player's view is surrounded by a border). Normally this is undesir-
              able, but it can help speed up the game. Can be changed in the game
              with  the +/- keys, this variable is just to preserve that setting.

       usegamma
              Selects a level of gamma correction (extra screen  brightening)  to
              correct  for  a dark monitor or light surroundings. Can be selected
              in the game with the F11 key, this config entry preserves that set-
              ting.

       X_options
              Sets  various  misc options used by the X version, xprboom. Default
              is 0;  add 1 to disable MitSHM, add 2  to  select  alternate  24bpp
              code (use this if xprboom has video corruption in 24bpp visuals).

       causes  in  the game); these are easiest set from the in-game menus, these
       config entries are to preserve the settings between games.

       use_mouse
              Enable or disable the use of a mouse with PrBoom.

KKEEYY BBIINNDDIINNGGSS
       These  specify  the keys that trigger various actions in PrBoom. The codes
       used for keys are internal to PrBoom, though many keys are represented  by
       their  ASCII  codes.  It  is easiest to modify these via the in-game menus
       (OPTIONS->SETUP->KEY BINDINGS). These config  file  entries  preserve  the
       settings from this menu between game sessions.

       calibration (the values received from the kernel driver outside  of  which
       movement is caused in the game). Also there are the button-bindings, again
       best adjusted using the in-game menus.

       use_joystick
              This selects the number of the joystick to use,  or  0  selects  no
              joystick. You have to have the relevant device files (/dev/js0 etc)
              and the kernel driver loaded.
