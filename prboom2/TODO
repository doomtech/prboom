3.  Testing on Voodoo.

Proff:
It runs, but on Voodoo1 cards it's very very slow. Other cards aren't tested,
but I guess on Voodoo3s and above it should work.
2000/10/04:
It does work with the beta OpenGL driver, but with the normal drivers only at
a very low framerate. Further testing needed.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
6.  Import MBF m_menu.c and m_misc.c stuff

Colin:
m_menu.c done, m_misc.c I don't intend to import, at least not at this
stage. It may be simpler to rewrite it. Let's delay that to a later
release.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
13. Repackage editing docs; I suggest that with all of
    the Boom and MBF stuff to go in, that we distribute
    the editing docs separately.
    (Could be done after a release though).

Colin: will do after we release
... guess that means now. I'll begin thinking about it.

2000/10/08 Proff:
We support nearly everything of MBF, like multiple skys etc.
All that needs to be mentioned in the docs. Maybe we should combine the
boomedit and mbfedit docs.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
15. Hardware music synth support for SDL target. timidity is
    nice, but some of the music sounds no good (notably MAP01).
    I suggest a cheat code to toggle software vs hardware.
    At least, for Linux this is easy, just call the old music
    server. (Not essential for first release).

Proff:
This will be added to SDL_mixer, so we can do that after the release with
an updated dll.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
18. Website.

Proff:
I did the windows download page and the front page.
Maybe we should do a developer page.
2000/10/04:
What about adding some stuff from the lxdoom website.

Colin:
I'm going to move over some more content this weekend. And the Linux 
Doom FAQ author is going to update it to point to PrBoom soon, 
hopefully.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
21. Bug with the CapsLock key.

Proff:
Works, but you have to press it twice to change running speed (why?).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
23. Update the README

Colin: there will probably be some FAQs to go in here, like "how to 
 get higher resolutions", but we'll see.

2000/10/04 Proff:
The version needs to be corrected in boom.cfg.5 and
README.command-line
Maybe README.command-line should be renamed to README.options.
From the next release on I will add .txt to all text files.

2000/10/08 Colin: OK added a bit on the GL options, not that I know 
	much about them myself :-)

2000/10/08 Proff:
The cfg-file for glboom is called glboom.cfg not prboom.cfg.
This needs to be fixed.
gl_drawskys is indeed the option to turn sky drawing on and off, it's
there so I can let people test if that's causing the problems on Voodoos.
gl_sortsprites might speed up with the cost of sorting errors with
transparent sprites. But the speedup is not very high.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
24. (2000/10/04) Seperating segs and gl_segs etc.

2000/10/08 Proff:
That's not as easy as I thought.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
25. (2000/10/04) Loading gl_nodes in softwaremode for higher accuracy

2000/10/08 Proff:
Did it.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
26. (2000/10/04) Is the current version for demos updated to 211?

2000/10/07 colin: I added a new compatibility level, yes.

2000/10/08 Proff:
It seems like that in G_BeginRecording the version for new recorded Demos
is still 210. Is that correct, or does it have to be 211.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
27. (2000/10/08) There is a memory leak in the OpenGL part.

2000/10/08 Proff:
Everytime a level is loaded some bytes more are allocated. It seems to be
dependant on the size of level how much is allocated. I just can't find
the leak.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
28. (2000/10/08) SigSegv on 30uv1617.lmp and hrdem2\hr22-uv.lmp

2000/10/08 Proff:
I was able to reproduce those SigSegv, it happens in the assembler
version of R_DrawColumn_Normal in drawasm.nas
Have to check that.
