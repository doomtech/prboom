Entrys marked by a * are fixed.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.  Testing on Voodoo.

Proff:
It runs, but on Voodoo1 cards it's very very slow. Other cards aren't tested,
but I guess on Voodoo3s and above it should work.
2000/10/04:
It does work with the beta OpenGL driver, but with the normal drivers only at
a very low framerate. Further testing needed.
2001/06/15:
It does work with Mesa3D with Gilde support. Voodoo I doesn't have enough
texture Ram, but newer cards should work.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
*15. Hardware music synth support for SDL target. timidity is
    nice, but some of the music sounds no good (notably MAP01).
    I suggest a cheat code to toggle software vs hardware.
    At least, for Linux this is easy, just call the old music
    server. (Not essential for first release).

Proff:
This will be added to SDL_mixer, so we can do that after the release with
an updated dll.
2001/02/18 Proff: Released new SDL_mixer_beta.dll
2002/07/28 Proff: This is in SDL_mixer for some time now

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
21. Bug with the CapsLock key.

Proff:
Works, but you have to press it twice to change running speed (why?).
2001/06/16:
Just read that this is a problem with SDL in Windows, should be no problem
in X11 etc. Might also get fixed soon by the SDL people.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
24. (2000/10/04) Seperating segs and gl_segs etc.

2000/10/08 Proff:
That's not as easy as I thought.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
27. (2000/10/08) There is a memory leak in the OpenGL part.

2000/10/08 Proff:
Everytime a level is loaded some bytes more are allocated. It seems to be
dependant on the size of level how much is allocated. I just can't find
the leak.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
29. (2000/11/08) Rewrite the networking

Colin: It's frankly a disaster area, which I can say with confidence
 because I wrote it. I had experimental builds of lxdoom which allowed 
 selection of game parameters in-game, asynchronous game joining (but 
 not in-game joining). We need a decent reliable-sequenced-packets-over-UDP 
 library (or just switch to TCP) too, rather than the current lash-up.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
30. (2000/11/13) Port joystick stuff to SDL

2001/02/18 proff: Done, but this whole input crap should be redone.
2002/07/28 proff: partly redone with the console system and the new axes
 stuff

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
*33. (2000/12/24) Single key quit

Colin: opulent wants the old 'q quits demo recording' feature back. 
 This is trivial with the new keybindings system, "bind q quit".

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
34. (2001/03/29) Dreamcast port

Proff: I have to get off my ass and do the Dreamcast port of this.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
35. (2001/03/29) FraggleScript and DDF?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
36. (2001/06/16) The Dynamic OpenGL loading doesn't work correctly.

Proff: I noticed that it doesn't work as expected. Also seems to cause
problems on Sparc, but this is not certain.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
37. (2001/07/01) TASDoom demo support

Colin: So far I know it's based on DosDoom v0.47, source for which isn't
available anywhere public to my knowledge; TASDoom itself is a modified version
thereof, only Yonatan has the source for it and may need some persuading to
part with it, but I may have a go, might try reverse engineering it first.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

39. (2001/07/01) w_wad.c/z_zone.c reorganisation

Colin: 
Proff: Isn't this partly done already?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
40. (2001/07/01) Doom v1.2 support

Colin: new compatibility level and option went in awhile ago, just have to do
the actual supporting code. (And no, not planning to support v1.2 demos :)
Proff: How much is there to do?
Colin: comp_midanim is already in; comp_666 is partly in and just needs the
 actual 666 tag changes. That's all I intend to do for now.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
41. (2001/07/28) Chasecam?

Colin: I did a quick hack and got the chasecam from SMMU working in prboom.
Seems to be fairly simple, altho its logic is in need of refinement

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
42. (2001/10/14) d_deh.c improvements

Colin: Proff's merge of the Eternity BEX extensions, and get rid of the old
dehfgets stuff.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
43. (2001/10/14) Gamma correction

Colin: From a discussion on #sdl I learned SDL does its own gamma correction -
we can save a few kb and some code by using theirs and dumping our own gamma
correction.
Proff: Should work for all paletted targets. Maybe it doesn't work in some SDL
 implementations? Have to ask on the SDL list and look into documentation.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
44. (2001/10/20) Fix wall/floor brightness calcs

Colin: Fix the current madness based on screen scale, dump the pointless lookup
tables, and use all 32 light graduations available (currently there are only 16
distinct sector brightness levels, the extra levels are used only for light
diminishing).
Colin: done for walls & sprites; lookups remain for floors so far, which is a it
trickier to change.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
45. (2002/07/28) OpenGL currently seems to be broken

Proff: Fix that and add improvements from 2.2.x

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
46. (2002/07/28) Fix all current loose ends

Proff:
- fix new menu system
- fix config system
- sort the config file alphabetically
- fix new axes support
- add everything new from 2.2.x

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
47. (2002/07/28) Wishlist for the future

Proff:
- ingame selection of wads and demos
- I thought about using morton order (z-order or n-order) for the screen
  buffer. This might speed up the rendering at higher resolutions. But
  after some source browsing, I think it's too much work which might not
  even bring the speed up.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
*48. (2002/08/05) comp_sound

Colin:
The purists want a sound compatibility option that prevents the player hearing
other coop/dm player weapon pickup noise (as in the original game I'm told).
Conversely, !comp_sound could, e.g., get rid of the silent BFG and other sound
anomalies.

> From bahdko@erols.com:
> When the player jumps down from a ledge or is injured, the "grunt sound" 
> should cause the sound of a firing BFG to be canceled, [...]
> 
> Players must not be able to hear other players pick up items or weapons.

Colin: done; just needs #49 below so peopl can use in DM.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
49. (2002/08/07) game options in netgames

The server currently controls these, but lacks a way to set them. In particular
the classic Doom DM types like to be able to turn on the comp_ options. We could
have a v1.9 flag to use traditional options, or we could make the server parse a
prboom.cfg to get the options. Or we could implement in-game game launching, the
big option.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
50. (2002/08/10) make SLOWTURNTICS configureable
