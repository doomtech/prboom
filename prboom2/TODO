Entrys marked by a * are fixed.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.  Testing on Voodoo.

Proff:
It runs, but on Voodoo1 cards it's very very slow. Other cards aren't tested,
but I guess on Voodoo3s and above it should work.
2000/10/04:
It does work with the beta OpenGL driver, but with the normal drivers only at
a very low framerate. Further testing needed.
2001/06/15:
It does work with Mesa3D with Gilde support. Voodoo I doesn't have enough
texture Ram, but newer cards should work.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
6.  Import MBF m_menu.c and m_misc.c stuff

Colin:
m_menu.c done, m_misc.c I don't intend to import, at least not at this
stage. It may be simpler to rewrite it. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
13. Repackage editing docs; I suggest that with all of
    the Boom and MBF stuff to go in, that we distribute
    the editing docs separately.
    (Could be done after a release though).

2000/11/08 Colin: working on it. Using it as an excuse to learn SGML :-)
2001/02/18 Proff: New directory was added by Colin some time ago

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
15. Hardware music synth support for SDL target. timidity is
    nice, but some of the music sounds no good (notably MAP01).
    I suggest a cheat code to toggle software vs hardware.
    At least, for Linux this is easy, just call the old music
    server. (Not essential for first release).

Proff:
This will be added to SDL_mixer, so we can do that after the release with
an updated dll.
2001/02/18 Proff: Released new SDL_mixer_beta.dll

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
21. Bug with the CapsLock key.

Proff:
Works, but you have to press it twice to change running speed (why?).
2001/06/16:
Just read that this is a problem with SDL in Windows, should be no problem
in X11 etc. Might also get fixed soon by the SDL people.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
24. (2000/10/04) Seperating segs and gl_segs etc.

2000/10/08 Proff:
That's not as easy as I thought.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
27. (2000/10/08) There is a memory leak in the OpenGL part.

2000/10/08 Proff:
Everytime a level is loaded some bytes more are allocated. It seems to be
dependant on the size of level how much is allocated. I just can't find
the leak.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
29. (2000/11/08) Rewrite the networking

Colin: It's frankly a disaster area, which I can say with confidence
 because I wrote it. I had experimental builds of lxdoom which allowed 
 selection of game parameters in-game, asynchronous game joining (but 
 not in-game joining). We need a decent reliable-sequenced-packets-over-UDP 
 library (or just switch to TCP) too, rather than the current lash-up.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
30. (2000/11/13) Port joystick stuff to SDL

2001/02/18 proff: Done, but this whole input crap should be redone.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
33. (2000/12/24) Single key quit

Colin: opulent wants the old 'q quits demo recording' feature back. 
 I suggest making it a configurable key setting, not bound to any 
 key by default.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
34. (2001/03/29) Dreamcast port

Proff: I have to get off my ass and do the Dreamcast port of this.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
35. (2001/03/29) FraggleScript and DDF?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
36. (2001/06/16) The Dynamic OpenGL loading doesn't work correctly.

Proff: I noticed that it doesn't work as expected. Also seems to cause
problems on Sparc, but this is not certain.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
37. (2001/07/01) TASDoom demo support

Colin: So far I know it's based on DosDoom v0.47, source for which isn't
available anywhere public to my knowledge; TASDoom itself is a modified version
thereof, only Yonatan has the source for it and may need some persuading to
part with it, but I may have a go, might try reverse engineering it first.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

39. (2001/07/01) w_wad.c/z_zone.c reorganisation

Colin: 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
40. (2001/07/01) Doom v1.2 support

Colin: new compatibility level and option went in awhile ago, just have to do
the actual supporting code. (And no, not planning to support v1.2 demos :)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
41. (2001/07/28) Chasecam?

Colin: I did a quick hack and got the chasecam from SMMU working in prboom.
Seems to be fairly simple, altho its logic is in need of refinement

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
42. (2001/10/14) d_deh.c improvements

Colin: Proff's merge of the Eternity BEX extensions, and get rid of the old
dehfgets stuff.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
43. (2001/10/14) Gamma correction

Colin: From a discussion on #sdl I learned SDL does its own gamma correction -
we can save a few kb and some code by using theirs and dumping our own gamma
correction.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
44. (2001/10/20) Fix wall/floor brightness calcs

Colin: Fix the current madness based on screen scale, dump the pointless lookup
tables, and use all 32 light graduations available (currently there are only 16
distinct sector brightness levels, the extra levels are used only for light
diminishing).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
