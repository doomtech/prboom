Entrys marked by a * are fixed.

3.  Testing on Voodoo.

Proff:
It runs, but on Voodoo1 cards it's very very slow. Other cards aren't tested,
but I guess on Voodoo3s and above it should work.
2000/10/04:
It does work with the beta OpenGL driver, but with the normal drivers only at
a very low framerate. Further testing needed.
2001/06/15:
It does work with Mesa3D with Gilde support. Voodoo I doesn't have enough
texture Ram, but newer cards should work.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
21. Bug with the CapsLock key.

Proff:
Works, but you have to press it twice to change running speed (why?).
2001/06/16:
Just read that this is a problem with SDL in Windows, should be no problem
in X11 etc. Might also get fixed soon by the SDL people.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
27. (2000/10/08) There is a memory leak in the OpenGL part.

2000/10/08 Proff:
Everytime a level is loaded some bytes more are allocated. It seems to be
dependant on the size of level how much is allocated. I just can't find
the leak.

33. (2000/12/24) Single key quit

Colin: opulent wants the old 'q quits demo recording' feature back. 
 I suggest making it a configurable key setting, not bound to any 
 key by default.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
34. (2002/07/28) Fix documentation

Proff:
- add mp3 stuff
- add new opengl options
- update FAQ?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
35. (2002/07/28) Fix OpenGL segfault on Linux

Proff:
Possibly caused by using gluImageScale when paletted textures used.
Either write my own scaling functions, which would allow mipmapping
for paletted textures, or just kick the scaling. I'm for the first
if I get the time. Small fix would be disabling gluImageScale when
paletted textures used.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
36. (2002/07/28) Add option to move backward with second mousebutton

Proff: like it was in my old prboom version
