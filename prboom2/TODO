2.  Network in SDL.

Colin:
The BSD-sockets net code works. Jess is working on the SDL version. The
Linux SDL version current compiles using the BSD-sockets code fine though.

Proff:
This seems to work now.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.  Testing on Voodoo.

Proff:
It runs, but on Voodoo1 cards it's very very slow. Other cards aren't tested,
but I guess on Voodoo3s and above it should work.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.  Compiling on Linux with OpenGL

Jess:
Seems to work

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
5.  Does SDL_net work together with Colin's version?
    That would mean Windows->Linux and OpenGL->Linux, yeah ;)


--------------------------------------------------------------------------
6.  Import MBF m_menu.c and m_misc.c stuff

Colin:
m_menu.c done, m_misc.c I don't intend to import, at least not at this
stage. It may be simpler to rewrite it. Let's delay that to a later
release.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
8.  Verify Boom demos

Colin:
Don't appear to be working well. There aren't that many Boom demos though
so I think we can leave this until after a first release.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
12. Update README, AUTHORS

Proff:
I have added Nicolas Kalkhof to AUTHORS. It's ok for me now.

Colin:
I've done AUTHORS (well, updating the history) and the Linux install
instructions, and some misc feature docs. More to do still.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
13. Repackage editing docs; I suggest that with all of
    the Boom and MBF stuff to go in, that we distribute
    the editing docs separately.
    (Could be done after a release though).

Colin: will do after we release
    
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
14. Fix RPM packaging stuff for Linux targets (we do different
    RPMs for the two targets I think).
    
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
15. Hardware music synth support for SDL target. timidity is
    nice, but some of the music sounds no good (notably MAP01).
    I suggest a cheat code to toggle software vs hardware.
    At least, for Linux this is easy, just call the old music
    server. (Not essential for first release).

Proff:
This will be added to SDL_mixer, so we can do that after the release with
an updated dll.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
18. Website.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
20. 24bpp packed support fix in v_video_trans.c.

Colin:
On my list.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
21. Bug with the CapsLock key.

Proff:
On my list.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
22. Bug in Gostbuster TC. Works with PrBoom 2.02 but not in the current.

Proff:
On my list.
