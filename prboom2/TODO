Entrys marked by a * are fixed.

3.  Testing on Voodoo.

Proff:
It runs, but on Voodoo1 cards it's very very slow. Other cards aren't tested,
but I guess on Voodoo3s and above it should work.
2000/10/04:
It does work with the beta OpenGL driver, but with the normal drivers only at
a very low framerate. Further testing needed.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
15. Hardware music synth support for SDL target. timidity is
    nice, but some of the music sounds no good (notably MAP01).
    I suggest a cheat code to toggle software vs hardware.
    At least, for Linux this is easy, just call the old music
    server. (Not essential for first release).

Proff:
This will be added to SDL_mixer, so we can do that after the release with
an updated dll.
2001/02/18 Proff: Released new SDL_mixer_beta.dll

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
21. Bug with the CapsLock key.

Proff:
Works, but you have to press it twice to change running speed (why?).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
27. (2000/10/08) There is a memory leak in the OpenGL part.

2000/10/08 Proff:
Everytime a level is loaded some bytes more are allocated. It seems to be
dependant on the size of level how much is allocated. I just can't find
the leak.

30. (2000/11/13) Port joystick stuff to SDL

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
33. (2000/12/24) Single key quit

Colin: opulent wants the old 'q quits demo recording' feature back. 
 I suggest making it a configurable key setting, not bound to any 
 key by default.
