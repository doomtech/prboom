Entrys marked by a * are fixed.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.  Testing on Voodoo.

Proff:
It runs, but on Voodoo1 cards it's very very slow. Other cards aren't tested,
but I guess on Voodoo3s and above it should work.
2000/10/04:
It does work with the beta OpenGL driver, but with the normal drivers only at
a very low framerate. Further testing needed.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
6.  Import MBF m_menu.c and m_misc.c stuff

Colin:
m_menu.c done, m_misc.c I don't intend to import, at least not at this
stage. It may be simpler to rewrite it. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
13. Repackage editing docs; I suggest that with all of
    the Boom and MBF stuff to go in, that we distribute
    the editing docs separately.
    (Could be done after a release though).

2000/11/08 Colin: working on it. Using it as an excuse to learn SGML :-)
 Proff, perhaps you should make a new CVS directory for the editing 
 pack, since it's going to be a separate package?
2001/02/18 Proff: New directory was added by Colin some time ago

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
15. Hardware music synth support for SDL target. timidity is
    nice, but some of the music sounds no good (notably MAP01).
    I suggest a cheat code to toggle software vs hardware.
    At least, for Linux this is easy, just call the old music
    server. (Not essential for first release).

Proff:
This will be added to SDL_mixer, so we can do that after the release with
an updated dll.
2001/02/18 Proff: Released new SDL_mixer_beta.dll

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
21. Bug with the CapsLock key.

Proff:
Works, but you have to press it twice to change running speed (why?).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
24. (2000/10/04) Seperating segs and gl_segs etc.

2000/10/08 Proff:
That's not as easy as I thought.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
27. (2000/10/08) There is a memory leak in the OpenGL part.

2000/10/08 Proff:
Everytime a level is loaded some bytes more are allocated. It seems to be
dependant on the size of level how much is allocated. I just can't find
the leak.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
29. (2000/11/08) Rewrite the networking (medium term todo)

Colin: It's frankly a disaster area, which I can say with confidence
 because I wrote it. I had experimental builds of lxdoom which allowed 
 selection of game parameters in-game, asynchronous game joining (but 
 not in-game joining). We need a decent reliable-sequenced-packets-over-UDP 
 library (or just switch to TCP) too, rather than the current lash-up.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
30. (2000/11/13) Port joystick stuff to SDL

2001/02/18 proff: Done, but this whole input crap should be redone.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
33. (2000/12/24) Single key quit

Colin: opulent wants the old 'q quits demo recording' feature back. 
 I suggest making it a configurable key setting, not bound to any 
 key by default.
