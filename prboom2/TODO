Entrys marked by a * are fixed.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
33. (2000/12/24) Single key quit

Colin: opulent wants the old 'q quits demo recording' feature back. 
 I suggest making it a configurable key setting, not bound to any 
 key by default.
Proff: For 2.2.4?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
34. (2002/07/28) Fix documentation

Proff:
- add mp3 stuff
- add new opengl options
- update FAQ?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
*35. (2002/07/28) Fix OpenGL segfault on Linux

Proff:
Possibly caused by using gluImageScale when paletted textures used.
Either write my own scaling functions, which would allow mipmapping
for paletted textures, or just kick the scaling. I'm for the first
if I get the time. Small fix would be disabling gluImageScale when
paletted textures used.
Proff: Will hopefully be fixed in 2.3.x

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
*36. (2002/07/28) Add option to move backward with second mousebutton

Proff: like it was in my old prboom version
Proff: 2.3.x
