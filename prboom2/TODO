2.  Network in SDL.

Colin:
SDL_net version works fine on Linux now.

Proff:
This seems to work now.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.  Testing on Voodoo.

Proff:
It runs, but on Voodoo1 cards it's very very slow. Other cards aren't tested,
but I guess on Voodoo3s and above it should work.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
6.  Import MBF m_menu.c and m_misc.c stuff

Colin:
m_menu.c done, m_misc.c I don't intend to import, at least not at this
stage. It may be simpler to rewrite it. Let's delay that to a later
release.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
8.  Verify Boom demos

Colin:
Don't appear to be working well. There aren't that many Boom demos though
so I think we can leave this until after a first release.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
12. Update README, AUTHORS

Proff:
I have added Nicolas Kalkhof to AUTHORS. It's ok for me now.

Colin:
I've done AUTHORS (well, updating the history) and the Linux install
instructions, and some misc feature docs.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
13. Repackage editing docs; I suggest that with all of
    the Boom and MBF stuff to go in, that we distribute
    the editing docs separately.
    (Could be done after a release though).

Colin: will do after we release
    
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
14. Fix RPM packaging stuff for Linux targets (we do different
    RPMs for the two targets I think).

Colin: RPM is done, and I've committed to the website CVS a page 
telling people where to get all the other RPMs it needs. Done.
    
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
15. Hardware music synth support for SDL target. timidity is
    nice, but some of the music sounds no good (notably MAP01).
    I suggest a cheat code to toggle software vs hardware.
    At least, for Linux this is easy, just call the old music
    server. (Not essential for first release).

Proff:
This will be added to SDL_mixer, so we can do that after the release with
an updated dll.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
18. Website.

Colin:
We have an about page listing features and history. I've done a download 
page for Linux. We still need a Windows download page, a front page to 
tie them all together, and... anything else?

Proff:
I did the windows download page and the front page.
Maybe we should do a developer page.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
20. 24bpp packed support fix in v_video_trans.c.

Colin:
We switched to SDL.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
21. Bug with the CapsLock key.

Proff:
Works, but you have to press it twice to change running speed (why?).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
22. Bug in Gostbuster TC. Works with PrBoom 2.02 but not in the current.

Proff:
It's not a bug, but a mbf_feature, the compatibility needs to be set to boom_compatibility.
Maybe this should be added to the compatibility menu with a extra option, like some other stuff.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
23. Update the README

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
24. totalleveltimes isn't working

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
25. Screen melt transition isn't perfect (at least on X11, the new screen 
 is flashed briefly before the melt)
