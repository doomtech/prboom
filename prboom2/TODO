3.  Testing on Voodoo.

Proff:
It runs, but on Voodoo1 cards it's very very slow. Other cards aren't tested,
but I guess on Voodoo3s and above it should work.
2000/10/04:
It does work with the beta OpenGL driver, but with the normal drivers only at
a very low framerate. Further testing needed.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
6.  Import MBF m_menu.c and m_misc.c stuff

Colin:
m_menu.c done, m_misc.c I don't intend to import, at least not at this
stage. It may be simpler to rewrite it. Let's delay that to a later
release.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
13. Repackage editing docs; I suggest that with all of
    the Boom and MBF stuff to go in, that we distribute
    the editing docs separately.
    (Could be done after a release though).

Colin: will do after we release
... guess that means now. I'll begin thinking about it.
    
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
15. Hardware music synth support for SDL target. timidity is
    nice, but some of the music sounds no good (notably MAP01).
    I suggest a cheat code to toggle software vs hardware.
    At least, for Linux this is easy, just call the old music
    server. (Not essential for first release).

Proff:
This will be added to SDL_mixer, so we can do that after the release with
an updated dll.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
18. Website.

Proff:
I did the windows download page and the front page.
Maybe we should do a developer page.
2000/10/04:
What about adding some stuff from the lxdoom website.

Colin:
I'm going to move over some more content this weekend. And the Linux 
Doom FAQ author is going to update it to point to PrBoom soon, 
hopefully.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
21. Bug with the CapsLock key.

Proff:
Works, but you have to press it twice to change running speed (why?).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
23. Update the README

Colin: there will probably be some FAQs to go in here, like "how to 
 get higher resolutions", but we'll see.
2000/10/04 Proff: The version needs to be corrected in boom.cfg.5 and
README.command-line
Maybe README.command-line should be renamed to README.options.
From the next release on I will add .txt to all text files.
2000/10/07 Colin: gl options into boom.cfg.5, will make a start on this.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
24. (2000/10/04) Seperating segs and gl_segs etc.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
25. (2000/10/04) Loading gl_nodes in softwaremode for higher accuracy

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
26. (2000/10/04) Is the current version for demos updated to 211?

2000/10/07 colin: I added a new compatibility level, yes.
