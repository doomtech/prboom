3.  Testing on Voodoo.

Proff:
It runs, but on Voodoo1 cards it's very very slow. Other cards aren't tested,
but I guess on Voodoo3s and above it should work.
2000/10/04:
It does work with the beta OpenGL driver, but with the normal drivers only at
a very low framerate. Further testing needed.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
6.  Import MBF m_menu.c and m_misc.c stuff

Colin:
m_menu.c done, m_misc.c I don't intend to import, at least not at this
stage. It may be simpler to rewrite it. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
13. Repackage editing docs; I suggest that with all of
    the Boom and MBF stuff to go in, that we distribute
    the editing docs separately.
    (Could be done after a release though).

2000/11/08 Colin: working on it. Using it as an excuse to learn SGML :-)
 Proff, perhaps you should make a new CVS directory for the editing 
 pack, since it's going to be a separate package?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
15. Hardware music synth support for SDL target. timidity is
    nice, but some of the music sounds no good (notably MAP01).
    I suggest a cheat code to toggle software vs hardware.
    At least, for Linux this is easy, just call the old music
    server. (Not essential for first release).

Proff:
This will be added to SDL_mixer, so we can do that after the release with
an updated dll.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
18. Website.

Proff:
I did the windows download page and the front page.
Maybe we should do a developer page.
2000/10/04:
What about adding some stuff from the lxdoom website.

Colin:
The MBF bugs page I moved over.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
21. Bug with the CapsLock key.

Proff:
Works, but you have to press it twice to change running speed (why?).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
23. Update the README

Colin: there will probably be some FAQs to go in here, like "how to 
 get higher resolutions", but we'll see.

2000/10/21 colin: ok; also someone on the DW forums was complaining about 
 PrBoom overwriting their boom.cfg... perhaps we should rename the non-GL
 version's conf file to prboom.cfg?

2000/11/08 colin: did both of the above.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
24. (2000/10/04) Seperating segs and gl_segs etc.

2000/10/08 Proff:
That's not as easy as I thought.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
25. (2000/10/04) Loading gl_nodes in softwaremode for higher accuracy

2000/10/08 Proff:
Did it.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
26. (2000/10/04) Is the current version for demos updated to 211?

2000/10/07 colin: I added a new compatibility level, yes.

2000/10/08 Proff:
It seems like that in G_BeginRecording the version for new recorded Demos
is still 210. Is that correct, or does it have to be 211.

2000/10/24 colin: Done, just needs some more testing

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
27. (2000/10/08) There is a memory leak in the OpenGL part.

2000/10/08 Proff:
Everytime a level is loaded some bytes more are allocated. It seems to be
dependant on the size of level how much is allocated. I just can't find
the leak.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
28. (2000/10/08) SigSegv on 30uv1617.lmp and hrdem2\hr22-uv.lmp

2000/10/08 Proff:
I was able to reproduce those SigSegv, it happens in the assembler
version of R_DrawColumn_Normal in drawasm.nas
Have to check that.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
29. (2000/11/08) Rewrite the networking (medium term todo)

Colin: It's frankly a disaster area, which I can say with confidence
 because I wrote it. I had experimental builds of lxdoom which allowed 
 selection of game parameters in-game, asynchronous game joining (but 
 not in-game joining). We need a decent reliable-sequenced-packets-over-UDP 
 library (or just switch to TCP) too, rather than the current lash-up.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
30. (2000/11/13) Port joystick stuff to SDL

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
33. (2000/12/24) Single key quit

Colin: opulent wants the old 'q quits demo recording' feature back. 
 I suggest making it a configurable key setting, not bound to any 
 key by default.
