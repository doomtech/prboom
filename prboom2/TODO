Entrys marked by a * are fixed.

3.  Testing on Voodoo.

Proff:
It runs, but on Voodoo1 cards it's very very slow. Other cards aren't tested,
but I guess on Voodoo3s and above it should work.
2000/10/04:
It does work with the beta OpenGL driver, but with the normal drivers only at
a very low framerate. Further testing needed.
2001/06/15:
It does work with Mesa3D with Gilde support. Voodoo I doesn't have enough
texture Ram, but newer cards should work.

21. Bug with the CapsLock key.

Proff:
Works, but you have to press it twice to change running speed (why?).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
27. (2000/10/08) There is a memory leak in the OpenGL part.

2000/10/08 Proff:
Everytime a level is loaded some bytes more are allocated. It seems to be
dependant on the size of level how much is allocated. I just can't find
the leak.

33. (2000/12/24) Single key quit

Colin: opulent wants the old 'q quits demo recording' feature back. 
 I suggest making it a configurable key setting, not bound to any 
 key by default.
