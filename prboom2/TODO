Entrys marked by a * are fixed.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
*3.  Testing on Voodoo.

Proff:
It runs, but on Voodoo1 cards it's very very slow. Other cards aren't tested,
but I guess on Voodoo3s and above it should work.
2000/10/04:
It does work with the beta OpenGL driver, but with the normal drivers only at
a very low framerate. Further testing needed.
2001/06/15:
It does work with Mesa3D with Gilde support. Voodoo I doesn't have enough
texture Ram, but newer cards should work.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
21. Bug with the CapsLock key.

Proff:
Works, but you have to press it twice to change running speed (why?).
2001/06/16:
Just read that this is a problem with SDL in Windows, should be no problem
in X11 etc. Might also get fixed soon by the SDL people.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
24. (2000/10/04) Seperating segs and gl_segs etc.

2000/10/08 Proff:
That's not as easy as I thought.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
27. (2000/10/08) There is a memory leak in the OpenGL part.

2000/10/08 Proff:
Everytime a level is loaded some bytes more are allocated. It seems to be
dependant on the size of level how much is allocated. I just can't find
the leak.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
29. (2000/11/08) Rewrite the networking

Colin: It's frankly a disaster area, which I can say with confidence
 because I wrote it. I had experimental builds of lxdoom which allowed
 selection of game parameters in-game, asynchronous game joining (but
 not in-game joining). We need a decent reliable-sequenced-packets-over-UDP
 library (or just switch to TCP) too, rather than the current lash-up.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
30. (2000/11/13) Port joystick stuff to SDL

2001/02/18 proff: Done, but this whole input crap should be redone.
2002/07/28 proff: partly redone with the console system and the new axes
 stuff
proff: Just needs a nice menu.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
*33. (2000/12/24) Single key quit

Colin: opulent wants the old 'q quits demo recording' feature back.
 I suggest making it a configurable key setting, not bound to any
 key by default.
Proff: Should be done with the console.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
34. (2001/03/29) Dreamcast port

Proff: I have to get off my ass and do the Dreamcast port of this.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
35. (2001/03/29) FraggleScript and DDF?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
*36. (2001/06/16) The Dynamic OpenGL loading doesn't work correctly.

Proff: I noticed that it doesn't work as expected. Also seems to cause
problems on Sparc, but this is not certain.
Proff: New version seems to work fine, needs field testing.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
37. (2001/07/01) TASDoom demo support

Colin: So far I know it's based on DosDoom v0.47, source for which isn't
available anywhere public to my knowledge; TASDoom itself is a modified version
thereof, only Yonatan has the source for it and may need some persuading to
part with it, but I may have a go, might try reverse engineering it first.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

39. (2001/07/01) w_wad.c/z_zone.c reorganisation

Colin:
Proff: Isn't this partly done already?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
40. (2001/07/01) Doom v1.2 support

Colin: new compatibility level and option went in awhile ago, just have to do
the actual supporting code. (And no, not planning to support v1.2 demos :)
Proff: How much is there to do?
Colin: comp_midanim is already in; comp_666 is partly in and just needs the
 actual 666 tag changes. That's all I intend to do for now.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
41. (2001/07/28) Chasecam?

Colin: I did a quick hack and got the chasecam from SMMU working in prboom.
Seems to be fairly simple, altho its logic is in need of refinement

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
42. (2001/10/14) d_deh.c improvements

Colin: Proff's merge of the Eternity BEX extensions, and get rid of the old
dehfgets stuff.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
43. (2001/10/14) Gamma correction

Colin: From a discussion on #sdl I learned SDL does its own gamma correction -
we can save a few kb and some code by using theirs and dumping our own gamma
correction.
Proff: Should work for all paletted targets. Maybe it doesn't work in some SDL
 implementations? Have to ask on the SDL list and look into documentation.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
44. (2001/10/20) Fix wall/floor brightness calcs

Colin: Fix the current madness based on screen scale, dump the pointless lookup
tables, and use all 32 light graduations available (currently there are only 16
distinct sector brightness levels, the extra levels are used only for light
diminishing).
Colin: done for walls & sprites; lookups remain for floors so far, which is a it
trickier to change.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
46. (2002/07/28) Fix all current loose ends

Proff:
- fix new menu system
  - Options
  - Features
*    - FEATURES graphic and others
  - VIDD ?
- fix config system
  proff: The system itself seems to work fine now, but many options are still
         missing.
- Bindings for:
  Help - F1
*- fix Keypad names (KEY_289 = KP_* or something)
- fix testframerate (shouldn't exit now that we have a console)
*- sort the config file alphabetically
*- fix new axes support
- add everything new from 2.2.x - Done?
  - RANGECHECK in v_video.c for pbuf* etc.
  - Don't treat linedef types in the 0x8000-0xffff range as generalised
    floor types.
  - Fix SEGV on failed lookup for BEX codepointer.
  - Mead's/Colin's countable item automap highlighting.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
47. (2002/07/28) Wishlist for the future

Proff:
- ingame selection of wads and demos
- I thought about using morton order (z-order or n-order) for the screen
  buffer. This might speed up the rendering at higher resolutions. But
  after some source browsing, I think it's too much work which might not
  even bring the speed up.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
*48. (2002/08/05) comp_sound

Colin:
The purists want a sound compatibility option that prevents the player hearing
other coop/dm player weapon pickup noise (as in the original game I'm told).
Conversely, !comp_sound could, e.g., get rid of the silent BFG and other sound
anomalies.

> From bahdko@erols.com:
> When the player jumps down from a ledge or is injured, the "grunt sound"
> should cause the sound of a firing BFG to be canceled, [...]
>
> Players must not be able to hear other players pick up items or weapons.

Colin: done; just needs #49 below so peopl can use in DM.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
49. (2002/08/07) game options in netgames

The server currently controls these, but lacks a way to set them. In particular
the classic Doom DM types like to be able to turn on the comp_ options. We could
have a v1.9 flag to use traditional options, or we could make the server parse a
prboom.cfg to get the options. Or we could implement in-game game launching, the
big option.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
*50. (2002/08/10) make SLOWTURNTICS configureable

Proff: done. (g_slowturntics)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
51. (2002/08/14) new demo format for prboom 2.3.0

Colin: Time to ditch the "compression" in Doom demos where the low byte of
cmd->angleturn is thrown away, this very significantly degrades the playabiity
of the game when recording. Secondly, possibly we could allow sync critical
options to change in demos by recording the console commands executed.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
52. (2002/07/28) Fix documentation

Proff:
- add mp3 stuff
- add new opengl options
- update FAQ?

53. (2004/07/26) Crash on fullscreen 320x200 8Bit

Proff: Only happens to me????

53. (2003/09/22) found by bahdko

- autorun not working
- compatibility settings not correct in netgame
- chat strings not sent
- allow multiline chat strings
- menu layout for binding keys not good
- repeat backspace key
- keep ability to record network demos only when all people record
- allow one key for more than one action (don't delete already bound actions)

54. From the doomworld comments

[QUOTE][i]ukiro said:[/i]
[B]I'm too lazy to contact the author(s)... so here are some bugs (se my system specs at the bottom):

"test framerate" won't work if you've changed resolution unless you restart
[/B][/QUOTE]
Have to look at that.
[QUOTE][B]
"always run" setting omitted from menus (available through console though)
[/B][/QUOTE]
Thanks for pointing out that it works from the console.
[QUOTE][B]
when doing -fastdemo and starting a game while demo is running, game speed it set to that of the fastdemo

-timedemo doesn't give me a result; where am I supposed to see the # of gametics?
[/B][/QUOTE]
It's printed to the console, but I don't know if PrBoom quits after -timedemo (writing this without being able to test).
[QUOTE][B]
the IWAD loading is very very buggy, hardly works at all
[/B][/QUOTE]
Hmm, have to test that again. If you don't set -iwad on the commandline it should work.
[QUOTE][B]
OpenGL mode took a while to find in the BPP settings... why hide it there?
[/B][/QUOTE]
Tell me a better place.
[QUOTE][B]
in full view (no statbar) weapons are drawn too high
[/B][/QUOTE]
Have to look at that.
[QUOTE][B]
also I'm getting desynch problems with Final DOOM demos, even when loading DOOM2.WAD as IWAD and TNT.WAD/PLUTONIA.WAD as PWAD. Still testing ways to get that to work though.
[/B][/QUOTE]
It should work if you set tnt/plutonia as the iwad, otherwise PrBoom doesn't recognize them. If not, please send a link to an offending demo.
